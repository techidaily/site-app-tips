Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137211/26400" target="_top" id="2137211">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137211" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137211/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Gale Healthcare Solutions is a Tampa, Florida tech company that connects healthcare workers with healthcare organizations looking to hire people for certain shifts. </p><p>Fowler said the information also included forms about certain incidents, disciplines and terminations. </p><p>“We only reviewed a limited sampling of documents and did not review each and every file. The files were hosted on an AWS cloud server, and many of the registration documents were open and publicly accessible,” Fowler told <em>ZDNet</em>. </p><p>“The images I saw were usually of the healthcare worker’s face or ID badge, but the URL contained their full name, SSN and a number consistent with an SSN. Here is an example of how the link appeared: .com&#x2F;gale-registration-documents&#x2F;documents&#x2F;last_name_first_name-LPN&#x2F;-SSN-*********.jpeg. I called several individuals and validated only that these were real people and their information matched that in the files.” </p><p>Fowler explained that he didn’t feel it was appropriate to ask victims for their SSN or ask them to validate the information due to the highly sensitive nature of SSNs. </p><p>“These people have a hard enough job without a random stranger calling them and reading out their SSN to them. If the names, phone numbers, and locations of these individuals matched those who I called and validated, it is logical to assume that the number indicated as SSN would most likely be real,” he added. </p><p>“I can only speculate that someone at Gale likely assumed this would make content management easier if the link had all needed information and could be easily indexed in a readable format and not a more secure unidentifiable internal code ID structure. They also overlooked that these URL paths and file names were not secure or private. Even if the images did not contain pictures of SSN cards, an exposure in the numerical text of the image name is just as much of a privacy risk and identity threat.”</p><p>Gale Healthcare Solutions initially did not respond to requests for comment, but after this story was published, it sent in a statement disputing some of what Fowler and Website Planet found. </p><p>The company said the database was a “temporary environment created for an internal system test.” </p><p>“When the researcher notified us of a potential vulnerability in September, the environment had already been deactivated and secured. There is no evidence there was any further unauthorized access beyond the researcher or that any personal data has been, or will be, misused,” the company said in a statement to <em>ZDNet</em>. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132160/7443" target="_top" id="2132160">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132160" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132160/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends-1"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-1" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ethical-hacking-certification/" >The best ethical hacking certifications Becoming a certified ethical hacker can lead to a rewarding career.

Rather, file names featured auto-generated sequential ten-digit Unix timestamps that were used in the testing environment. Dates of birth were also not disclosed, and to our knowledge, the accounts did not contain active links to images of tax documents or other credentials.”</p><p>Fowler and other ethical hackers with Website Planet search for serious data leaks by investigating open, unprotected databases that it finds randomly, never targeting specific companies.</p><p>The 170,239 records covered medical workers, nurses, and caregivers. In a report, Fowler explained that internal email addresses, usernames, and administrative passwords were stored in plain text.</p><p>Fowler and his team contacted Gale, and public access to the databases was closed the same day. The company never responded to their questions. </p><p>During his investigation of the database, Fowler found that multiple administrative accounts used weak passwords, noting that in a sampling of 10,000 records, “Password” appeared 2,921 times.</p><p>“We could also see multiple internal Admin accounts that used very similar and easy passwords. This is the first time I have ever seen full names and a number called ‘SSN’ in the actual file name. In theory, the file wouldn’t have to be opened to expose sensitive data because the file name alone contained what appeared to be PII (personally identifiable information),” Fowler added. </p><p>“The Covid 19 pandemic has hit healthcare workers hard with long hours, and many are physically and emotionally exhausted. Hospitals all over the United States are suffering from a shortage of healthcare workers. Any service that allows hospitals to fill their shifts is extremely important and valuable to sick patients. Unfortunately, this incident may have exposed the data of frontline workers during an already difficult time. Healthcare workers’ private information publicly available also poses a risk of unwanted harassment, intimidation, or cyberstalking.” </p><p>Fowler said it was unclear how long the database had been exposed and who else may have accessed it.

The Asia-Pacific region also is expected to clock the second-highest year-on-year growth at 20.4% this year, ahead of Europe’s 15.5% and North America’s 6.4%. Latin America leads the global growth rate at 23.2%.</p><p>The study found that Non-cash transactions tipped at 1.41 trillion in 2023 and will climb to 1.65 trillion this year and almost 2.84 trillion by 2028. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-moots-legislation-to-outlaw-use-of-deepfakes-during-elections/" >Singapore moots legislation to outlaw use of deepfakes during elections <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.capgemini.com/insights/research-institute/" >Capgemini research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is based on insights from its global corporate survey and interviews with banking and payments executives conducted in 2024. The research spans 15 markets including Singapore, Australia, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the UK. The global corporate survey polled 600 corporate treasurers from insurance, retail, and automotive, and the report also draws insights from interviews with more than 200 senior payment executives from financial organizations, including central banks, payment operators, and industry associations. </p><p>The study projects that instant payments will account for 22% of all non-cash transactions by 2028, up from 16% in 2023. It added that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/southeast-asian-consumers-intensify-online-habits-spending-60-more/" >Asia-Pacific is driving the growth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of instant payments, with the segment already accounting for 26% of the region’s payment volumes in 2023, just behind 28% in Latin America. </p><p>In particular, Account-to-account instant payment transfers are emerging as a faster and cost-effective way to pay, bypassing expensive card networks, Capgemini said.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/3-banks-plan-to-retire-one-time-passwords-for-customers-with-digital-tokens/" >3 banks plan to retire one-time passwords for customers with digital tokens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“The rise in their popularity may threaten to challenge the dominance of traditional payment cards, with estimates suggesting they could offset 15% to 25% of future card transaction volume growth,” the study noted. It added that with interchange fees and interest charges a key profit source, financial institutions could deem this a significant risk, with the potential to cost industry incumbents billions in lost revenue.</p><p>With instant payments surging, banks are struggling to keep pace with the necessary infrastructure. Capgemini pointed to a “concerning technological maturity gap” between markets in its readiness to support instant payments. About 67% of banks are categorized as “medium preparedness” for business and technology. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is particularly challenging for banks in Europe, as the January 2025 deadline looms with regard to the Instant Payment Regulation. The mandate requires all banks and payment services providers in the region to have the capabilities to offer instant payments, with full receive and send functionalities in place by October 2025. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/banks-in-singapore-begin-sharing-data-to-combat-financial-crime/" >Banks in Singapore begin sharing data to combat financial crime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Citing Capgemini Financial Services’ assessment matrix, the consulting firm estimates that just 13% of European banks can claim to have a strong technology foundation to support instant payments. This figure is behind their peers in Asia – which leads the pack at 30%, followed by the Americas at 26%. </p><p>Just 5% of banks are deemed to have obtained high business and technology scores to secure their foothold as instant payment leaders. </p><p>However, almost all payment executives expressed <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/asian-banks-are-favorite-target-of-cybercooks-and-malicious-bots-their-preferred-tool/" >concerns about fraud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in instant payments. Such apprehension likely resulted in banks choosing to receive, but not send, instant payments, due to a lack of robust defenses, noted the Capgemini report. It highlighted that UK regulators had linked authorized push payment scams to losses totaling almost $505 million in 2022, with instant payments used in these cases. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/finance/banking/singapore-australia-amongst-four-central-banks-to-test-cross-border-digital-payments-platform/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/finance/banking/singapore-australia-amongst-four-central-banks-to-test-cross-border-digital-payments-platform/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22%3Cstrong%3ESingapore,%20Australia%20amongst%20four%20central%20banks%20to%20test%20cross-border%20digital%20payments%20platform%3C/strong%3E%22%7D"><strong>Singapore, Australia amongst four central banks to test cross-border digital payments platform</strong></a></p><p>Financial institutions also find it challenging to fully embrace open finance due to issues with non-standardized APIs (application programming interfaces), limited control over data use, and a lack of incentives to share data with third parties. </p><p>The report noted that just 17% of banks are at an advanced stage – where they are piloting or launching open finance products, while 39% are in the planning phase, conducting impact assessments. Another 23% expressed hesitance as they await regulatory clarity.</p><p>“Open finance is evolving from open banking using technology and data sharing to create a more transparent and interconnected financial ecosystem,” Capgemini said. “While its potential [is] immense, widespread adoption is uneven across the globe.”</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-can-upgrade-that-old-pc-to-windows-11-even-if-microsoft-says-no-these-readers-proved-it/"  title="Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no.

With its auto-fill feature, 1Password can automatically fill in information like your username, password, or credit card number. You can also share your information with trusted family or friends if needed.</p><p>The app is accessible across all your favorite devices, making access easy and secure. 1Password is compatible with Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android.

Furthermore, thanks to a recent update, users of Watchtower can monitor SSH key security risks. </p><p>The only downside is that 1Password does not offer a free plan, but the app does provide a free, 30-day trial without even requiring your credit card information – and the company will pay off any remaining time on your current bill if you’re looking to switch (in credit). At the time of writing, the password manager costs $2.99 per month, billed annually, or $4.99 for a family pack. </p><p>Business options are also available, with the newly-introduced 1Password Extended Access Management now widely available.</p><p>Overall, if you’re looking for a reliable and easy-to-use password manager with great features and account protection tools, 1Password is a top choice.

To help you make the right decision, you should consider the factors below.</p><ul><li><strong>Security:</strong> Security is the foremost priority when it comes to password managers. The most secure password managers offer advanced encryption and use secure protocols to protect personal information when transferring from the service to your device and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> Another important consideration is storage capacity. While some password managers limit the number of passwords you can store, others offer unlimited storage so that you can add all your information without restrictions.</li><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> It’s also essential to check if your preferred device is compatible with the password manager. The best options offer cross-platform compatibility, allowing you to access your data from multiple devices, including your computer, tablet, and mobile device.</li><li><strong>Accounts</strong>: If you want to assign more than one identity or online account to a person, consider whether or not the family (or business) accounts are value for money.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-the-best-password-managers"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-the-best-password-managers" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose the best password managers?"></a>How did we choose the best password managers?</h2><p>In compiling this list of the best password managers, we examined third-party reviews and opinions from security experts. We also have hands-on experience with these password management tools because that’s the only way to really get to know how usable a service is. </p><p>When selecting the best password manager, several crucial factors must be considered. These are some of the key elements that determine the best options:</p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> While some password managers are free, others may require a paid subscription to access all features. It’s important to weigh the cost against the benefits and select a password manager that meets your budget.</li><li><strong>Customer reviews</strong>: Customer experiences and feedback are very important. If usability is overlooked, it really doesn’t matter how secure or exceptional a password manager is. We consider customer reviews and ease of use as one of our most important criteria.</li><li><strong>Company reputation</strong>: As you will be trusting an organization to provide a secure lockbox for your credentials, we only include reputable vendors who perform frequent security audits.</li><li><strong>Use cases</strong>: We wanted to include a range of password managers suitable for consumer and business use cases and purposes.</li></ul><h2 id="How-does-a-password-manager-work"><a href="#How-does-a-password-manager-work" class="headerlink" title="How does a password manager work?"></a>How does a password manager work?</h2><p>Password managers are digital tools that can help you keep track of all your passwords and other sensitive information in a safe and organized manner. Once you create an account with a password manager, you can add your login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data into the password vault. You can add this information all at once or over time as you use different websites or apps.</p><p>The password manager will then store all your data in an encrypted format, making it extremely difficult for hackers to decipher. Whenever you visit a site or use an app requiring login credentials, the password manager can automatically fill in your username and password for you. This feature can save you a lot of time and hassle, especially if you have many different accounts to manage.</p><p>Another feature of the best password managers is the ability to generate strong passwords. These passwords are typically long and random, making them more difficult to guess or crack. Password managers can create and store these complex passwords for you, making it much easier to keep your accounts secure. </p><p>Password managers can be invaluable for anyone who wants to keep their online accounts safe and secure.</p><h2 id="Do-I-need-a-password-manager"><a href="#Do-I-need-a-password-manager" class="headerlink" title="Do I need a password manager?"></a>Do I need a password manager?</h2><p>In today’s digital age, almost everything we do requires a password, from social media to online banking, and it can be challenging to remember all the different passwords we create. The best way to manage these passwords is by using a password manager. Not only does it store your passwords in a central location, but it also provides strong encryption to keep your data safe from cybercriminals.</p><p>Using a password manager can also help prevent attacks and data breaches that expose your information to the wrong eyes. Cybercriminals use various methods to gain access to your passwords, from phishing attacks to brute-force attacks. Using a password manager, you can create strong, unique passwords for each account, reducing the risk of being hacked. Alternatively, some browsers, such as Google Chrome, will offer built-in password managers. </p><h2 id="Are-password-managers-safe"><a href="#Are-password-managers-safe" class="headerlink" title="Are password managers safe?"></a>Are password managers safe?</h2><p>Yes, password managers are safe as they use advanced encryption algorithms to protect your login credentials. When you use a password manager, your passwords are stored in an encrypted form, which means they can’t be accessed by anyone without the correct password or passphrase. </p><p>However, it is important to choose a reputable password manager and use a strong, unique password or passphrase to protect your account. You should also remember there’s no such thing as a 100% secure service, and on occasion, even the best password managers may have to patch and fix security vulnerabilities. </p><h2 id="Can-a-password-manager-be-hacked"><a href="#Can-a-password-manager-be-hacked" class="headerlink" title="Can a password manager be hacked?"></a>Can a password manager be hacked?</h2><p>While no system is completely invulnerable to hacking, the best password managers use strong encryption algorithms and other security measures to protect your data. They also require a strong master password or passphrase to access your account. It is important to use a unique and complex master password and enable two-factor authentication to increase security further.</p><h2 id="Can-I-use-a-password-manager-on-multiple-devices"><a href="#Can-I-use-a-password-manager-on-multiple-devices" class="headerlink" title="Can I use a password manager on multiple devices?"></a>Can I use a password manager on multiple devices?</h2><p>Yes, most password managers allow you to use your account on multiple devices, such as your computer, smartphone, or tablet. This means you can access your passwords and other login credentials from anywhere at any time.</p><h2 id="What-are-passwordless-options"><a href="#What-are-passwordless-options" class="headerlink" title="What are passwordless options?"></a>What are passwordless options?</h2><p>Passwords may, one day, become a thing of the past, although we have a long way to go.

FAQs about the iPad Video Players"></a>Part 3. FAQs about the iPad Video Players</h2><p> What are the supported video formats on iPad?</p><p> The iPad devices only support MOV, MP4, MPEG-4, M-JPEG, M4V, and H.264, which is very limited compared to other devices such as Android. If your video isn’t in these formats, you will need a third-party video player to support your video or convert the video into a newer format.</p><p>Is QuickTime supported on iPad?</p><p> Even though Apple Inc. created QuickTime, it still doesn’t support iOS devices, so you can rely on a system or third-party players on the market when video playing is needed.</p><p>Can I transfer iPad to Mac?</p><p> Well, it is possible when you connect the charging cable of the iPad to Mac, but if that doesn’t work, then you will need an app that supports the<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft/ios-transfer/" >iPad-to-Mac transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p>Conclusion</p><p> If videos aren’t playing on your iPad, then you might need an<strong>iPad video player</strong> as a quick solution to solve the problem. But, if you don’t like downloading a video player, then you can easily use the application we added in part 2 to solve the problem.</p><p>What do you think of this post?</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/" >1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/" >2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/" >3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/" >4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/" >5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Excellent</p><p>Rating: 4.9 &#x2F; 5 (based on 389 votes) Follow Us on <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/aiseesoft" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/AiseesoftStudio" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aiseesoft" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>More Reading</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/more-reading/video-player-with-speed-control-s.jpg" >Video Player With Speed Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/" >6 Best Video Players with Speed Control for Windows 10&#x2F;8&#x2F;7 and Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br> No matter you want to play videos at a faster or slower speed, you can rely on the best 6 video players with speed control in this article.

Users can pin fields from items, such as bank account details, a passport number or one-time codes, to the homescreen for quick access. </p><p>The mobile versions of 1Password 8 for Android, iPhone and iPad today follow the 1Password 8 release for Windows and macOS, which were both released in the past year.</p><p>The firm promises autofill in 1Password 8 for mobile will be faster and more precise for filling in payment card details, addresses and usernames. </p><p>1Password 8 comes with a new experience for Watchtower, its breach alert service based on an integration with <a class="link"   href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" >Have I Been Pwned <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The service gives users a security score based on the use of weak passwords, whether two-factor authentication is enabled, and previously compromised passwords. </p><p>The 1Password 8 app also has an answer to the use of security questions that some sites uses as fallback to forgotten passwords. The main problem with security question is that they are based on facts about a person’s life that can’t be changed but can be learned by attackers. One solution is to submit lies, but users need to remember them. 1Password 8 offers random answers instead and remembers them for you.</p><p>“Now you can generate random answers to security questions as easily as you generate a password. Just add a security question field to any item, and let 1Password generate an answer for you. Better security, no more guesswork,” <a class="link"   href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-ios-android/" >it says in a blogpost <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The app also features “Collections”, a custom group of vaults for different contexts, such as personal, work, and travel. These can be configured after tapping the vault icon. </p><p>AgileBits last year <a class="link"   href="https://1password.community/discussion/comment/601917/#Comment%5F601917" >stopped selling 1Password standalone licenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which were available for 1Password 7, to exclusively selling the product as a subscription-only service as is the case for 1Password 8.

Are we die-hard tech hoarders?</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>A recent botched transition to a new transport e-payment platform in Singapore might offer some answers. </p><p>On Jan. 9, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) <a class="link"   href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2024/1/news-releases/ez-link%5Fadult%5Fcardholders%5Fand%5Fnets%5Fflashpay%5Fcardholders%5Fto%5Ftransit%5Fto%5Fsimplygo.html" >announced that two legacy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stored value cards, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/finance/another-consortium-joins-race-for-singapore-digital-bank-licence/" >EZ-Link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and NETS FlashPay, would no longer be used to pay for public transport fares starting from June. The move is part of the country’s transition to the SimplyGo system that LTA said had commenced in 2019. </p><p>Apart from its use as payment for public bus and train fares, the contactless EZ-Link cards are also accepted as a payment option at various locations island-wide, including convenience stores, fast-food outlets, and taxis.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/everything-you-need-for-commuting-to-work/" >Everything you need for commuting to work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In its statement, LTA said most commuters would not be affected by the transition because they already are using SimplyGo EZ-Link or contactless bank cards. “Commuters using concession cards, such as seniors, students, Workfare Transport Concession Scheme cardholders, and persons with disabilities, will also not be affected,” said the transport authority, which noted that two in three adult-fare transactions on public transport are made using either SimplyGo EZ-Link or bank cards. </p><p>The transport authority probably wasn’t expecting the public outcry that swiftly followed. </p><p>In touting the benefits of SimplyGo, <a class="link"   href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltagov/news/press/2024/240109%5FSimplyGo%5FFAQs%5FAnnexB.pdf" >LTA said <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the platform’s mobile app allows commuters to top up their cards anytime via credit or debit card and receive notification when the balance on their SimplyGo card is low. They can also block further transactions if they lose their card. </p><p>However, there were general concerns these benefits would be lost on the elderly who may not be tech-savvy. Top on the list of grievances, though, is the omission of one key feature that is available on the existing EZ-Link ecosystem: the ability to view fare deductions and card balances as commuters pass through train station gates and bus card readers. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-identity-theft-protection-and-credit-monitoring-service/" >The best identity theft protection and credit monitoring services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>This capability quickly emerged as a basic function that many had come to expect – and already had access to – on their public transport infrastructure, and were promptly appalled the feature would no longer be available on a supposedly newer and better system. </p><p>In other words, why fix something that isn’t broken and then make it worse?</p><p>The backlash eventually drove <a class="link"   href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2024/1/news-releases/card-exchange-for-simplygo-ez-link-and-concession-cardholders.html" >LTA to backtrack on the migration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> two weeks later, with Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat acknowledging the “<a class="link"   href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/simplygo-full-adoption-push-ez-link-system-fares-judgment-error-2030-chee-hong-tat-4076996" >judgment error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ in pushing through the SimplyGo system. He added that LTA had “underestimated” commuters’ reliance on the ability to view card balances and fare deductions as they entered and exited train stations and buses. </p><p>Chee said the existing infrastructure will remain in place until at least 2030 and SG$40 million will be set aside to purchase new hardware and maintain the existing system to allow commuters to continue using EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay cards. This figure will not lead to an increase in public transport fares, the minister said, adding that the government instead will bear the cost. </p><p>Confirming that the current system will “not [be] sunset in 2024 as originally planned,” Chee said in a <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/hongtat.chee/posts/pfbid02ReXRLFriVj2xoxXLxZcBPJ718EjSUtNyqfzGeh6R64ghaVLKdKXugUT9881VfkeVl" >Facebook post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that a technical challenge was behind the decision to omit the ability to view card balances. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-you-need-for-safe-and-easy-holiday-travel/" >Everything you need for safe and easy holiday travel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Because account-based ticketing cards such as SimplyGo do not retain fares and card balance data, it would take “a few seconds” to retrieve the information from the backend system and display it at fare gates and on bus card readers, he explained. </p><p>“This would slow down the flow of commuters and cause long queues, especially during peak hours,” he said. “Unfortunately, there is currently no technical solution to this.”</p><p>Chee added that he had tasked LTA to assess ways to enhance the features and improve user experiences for account-based ticketing cards. In particular, the priority will be finding ways for these cards to provide what commuters want – to view fare deductions and card balances as they enter and exit trains and buses.</p><p>This new challenges beg the question, why wasn’t this feature a priority – or at least part of the development plan – in the transition toward the new system? </p><h2 id="Losing-sight-of-what-matters"><a href="#Losing-sight-of-what-matters" class="headerlink" title="Losing sight of what matters"></a>Losing sight of what matters</h2><p>To convince users to adopt new technology, you need to first give them a reason to do so. Start by identifying how the new technology can benefit them and the organization. And to identify the benefits the technology can provide, first understand how users operate and the organization functions. </p><p>Were the folks who laid out the development plan for SimplyGo commuters? If they were, surely they would have recognized the importance of ensuring a key existing function continued to be available in the new system? Even if the brains behind the new system weren’t commuters, they should have at least exposed it to a test user group comprising actual commuters who would have noted the missing feature.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-plan-a-vacation/" >How to use ChatGPT to plan a vacation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Underestimating the importance of user buy-in will more likely lead to a resistance to change and is a key reason why businesses end up having to retain legacy systems. That retention results in higher operational costs, which adds strain on existing resources and creates a wider surface area that needs to be secured. </p><p>Could the additional SG$40 million that the Singapore government now has to set aside to maintain the existing system have been put to better use by identifying alternative solutions earlier in the development process of SimplyGo? Why did the LTA team have to wait for the minister to instruct them to do that work? </p><p>It’s now more essential than ever before – amid the currently sparkling lure of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" >artificial intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -- that organizations keep their eyes firmly fixed on the users that any technology is supposed to benefit. </p><p>As Singapore has seen, it only takes one underestimated user feature to halt an entire migration plan and add years to a system otherwise headed for sunset. This error is an expensive legacy that the country, and businesses, can hopefully learn from.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fastest-vpn/"  title="The fastest VPNs: Expert tested and reviewed">The fastest VPNs: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra/"  title="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: I tested both and here are the key differences">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: I tested both and here are the key differences <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/"  title="How to upgrade your &#39;incompatible&#39; Windows 10 PC to Windows 11">How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-android-phone-is-getting-an-anti-theft-upgrade-thanks-to-ai-how-it-works/"  title="Your Android phone is getting an anti-theft upgrade, thanks to AI.

This is still an unanswered question. Everyone loves the concept of low-code and no-code development – even IT. <em>Especially</em> IT. In the process of offloading work from IT, low- and no-code provides end users a chance to exercise their own initiatives. But everyone needs to proceed with caution, as low-code and no-code may not work in all settings.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/low-and-no-code-paradox-freeing-up-tech-pros-time-but-creating-new-entanglements/"><strong>Low and no-code paradox: Freeing up tech pros’ time, but creating new entanglements</strong></a></p><p>A recent <a class="link"   href="https://www.jitterbit.com/report/2023-state-of-automation/" >survey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> finds 85% of organizations are interested in moving forward with low-code and no-code IT solutions, and just over half are comfortable with employees outside of IT using low-code application-building platforms. The survey, published by Jitterbit, finds that IT leaders are still nervous about low-code’s ability to solve key business challenges and, to a lesser extent, data security and accessibility issues. </p><p>At the same time, organizations may have little choice but to move forward with low-code and no-code to overcome prevailing and persistent technology talent shortages. “They can leverage powerful tools to automate tasks for faster, higher quality delivery, all while freeing up time for developers to focus their talents on more complex initiatives,” says <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-stein-b0237927/" >Robin Stein <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, partner with <a class="link"   href="http://www.pwc.com/" >PwC Labs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Shifting the paradigm on how they think about software development and embracing low code or no code is the key to unlocking capacity by leveraging employees beyond those in the core IT function.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>At this stage, organizations are beginning to sort out “what low and no-code platforms can solve and replace, while others do not,” says <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominikrose/" >Dominik Rose <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, VP of platform strategy at <a class="link"   href="http://www.leanix.net/" >LeanIX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. “For example, low and no-code solutions work well when combining existing IT solutions, like ERP, with solutions focused on meeting digital customer needs.” However, he continues, “It’s not the best approach for building scalable enterprise solutions. You can’t solve every customer problem with templated experiences. For this reason, companies have to find better ways to get the most out of existing platforms to reduce the need for boilerplate workarounds.”   </p><p>Different systems require different means and levels of orchestration, Rose points out. “Low and no-code solutions can definitely be leveraged for smart modernization of application landscapes, but at the end of the day, these platforms alone will not reduce the need for skilled developers.” </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/low-code-platforms-mean-anyone-can-be-a-developer-and-maybe-a-data-scientist-too/"><strong>Low-code platforms mean anyone can be a developer – and maybe a data scientist, too</strong></a></p><p>The low-code and no-code movement has been catalyzed by technical skills shortages, “as well as the massive shift to hybrid work,” agrees <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudhirmehta/" >Sudhir Mehta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, global vice president of <a class="link"   href="https://www.lexmark.com/en%5Fus/solutions/optra-iot-solutions/optra-iot-platform.html" >Optra Engineering at Lexmark International <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. “It offers an inherent agility to address business outcomes quickly and with less technical overhead – providing the power to a non-technical employee to address outcomes quickly with limited engineering or IT support.” </p><p>One caveat is that digital native environments may be more conducive than established systems to low-code and no-code approaches. “Low-code or no-code is more prevalent among companies with cloud-native and brand-new applications built from the ground up,” Mehta observes. “It plays well with cloud-based operations. It is less seen in businesses still running legacy and on-prem applications.” Of course, low-code and no-code can be plugged into a presentation or control layer within legacy settings, Mehta adds. </p><p>Still, IT professionals need to remain on standby, as there are risks in a strategy that seeks to push development out to business users. “Tech leaders should approach low-code or no-code strategically with a hybrid model – leveraging both low-code or no-code tools and full stack technologies,” says Stein. Build this environment around a “clear app graduation strategy and boundaries of where to leverage what technology,” she adds. “Deploying low-code and no-code technologies will not eliminate the need for a robust IT team.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-the-post-ai-developer-more-creative-more-business-focused/"><strong>Meet the post-AI developer: More creative, more business-focused</strong></a></p><p>A proliferation of low-code and no-code applications also runs the risk of poor performance, Rose cautions. “You want your solution or product to run smoothly for your customers. When you rely on vendors to help bring these products or solutions to reality, you ultimately rely on their timelines and upgrades to make sure you have a quality product. This could hinder progress on functionality altogether.”</p><p>Low-code and no-code also limits creativity, Rose says. “Development is not an isolated, technical activity. Building products that serve customers well is a craft – and one that a lot of the times requires a skilled developer.”</p><p>In most cases, “IT professionals should not need to intervene,” says Stein. “With the proper governance procedures in place, citizens should be able to develop and leverage their low-code apps, while monitoring solutions behind the scenes to help mitigate risk and ensure adherence to policy.” For example, “application usage can be monitored and as an application begins to gain popularity, IT professionals can then step in to help ensure the app is built to scale and can be supported across the organization, ensuring their time is being spent in areas of greater potential impact.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-are-my-5-favorite-ai-tools-for-work/"><strong>These are my 5 favorite AI tools for work</strong></a></p><p>Automation in a vacuum is not the answer to everything, Mehta points out. “You must take into account the entire chain these applications connect with. If an action is triggered, but the overall process is broken, then low-code and no-code is not going to address the gap. This is why business process and architects are still critical as they can look beyond individual apps to ensure that the overall architecture remains applicable and addresses overall digital transformation.” </p><h4 id="Developer"><a href="#Developer" class="headerlink" title="Developer"></a>Developer</h4><p><a class="link"

Organizations can also boost their competitiveness if they are given support to digitalize, decarbonize, and globalize.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/3-ways-to-find-a-great-ai-partner-for-your-enterprise/" >3 ways to secure the best AI partner for your business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> </p><p>These measures will be integral to helping enterprises, particularly small businesses, deal with rising costs and a challenging business environment in a softening global economy.</p><p>Research suggests just 25% of companies in Singapore are confident the economy will improve during the next 12 months, compared to 41% the year before, according to <a class="link"   href="https://www.sbf.org.sg/newsroom/media/press-releases/detail/singapore-business-sentiment-weakens-amidst-economic-uncertainties-tightening-credit-cost-increases-and-manpower-challenges" >SBF’s latest national business survey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Some 58% of companies cite increased business costs as the top challenge, with 75% pointing to manpower costs as the key contributor. The survey respondents would like more support from the government for their ESG initiatives, as well as adoption of AI tools and global expansion. </p><p>The SBF survey, which polled 1,056 companies, also anticipates 2024 being a more challenging year for local businesses that will face headwinds in domestic and international markets. </p><p>“We recommend the government takes the lead to streamline procurement practices with smaller enterprises that may rely heavily on government projects,” KPMG and SBF said in a joint statement. </p><p>“To tackle manpower constraints, Singapore must maintain its openness to overseas talent and strengthen policies that promote the development of local talent. A public-private review of business competitiveness is needed to identify opportunities for cost mitigation even as we press ahead with industry transformation.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-divergent-skills-that-matter-in-an-ai-world-math-and-business-development/"><strong>Two divergent skills that matter in an AI world: Math and business development</strong></a></p><p>The report authors call for a tiered support model to facilitate companies in their digitalization roadmaps, spanning from a lower-tier grant support covering 20% of backoffice and operational digitalization initiatives, to a top-tier grant of 60% in funding support for the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-looks-for-generative-ai-use-cases-with-sandbox-options/" >adoption of artificial intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (AI) and digital ledger technologies. </p><p>The report also suggests the government should reassess existing grants and subsidies, such as the Enterprise Innovation Scheme or Productivity Solutions Grant, and allow smaller companies to pay only the net cost of digital solutions to help them with their cash flow. Services providers can then claim the rest of the subsidies directly from the government. </p><p>Grant programs, the report suggests, should be expanded to include digital projects where development work is led out of Singapore, but involve resources from the region. The Enterprise Development Grant, for example, currently stipulates that such development work must be fulfilled locally. This restriction could stifle progress as businesses might not be able to access resources and skillsets to drive the work in a timely manner.</p><p>In addition, a universal grant program that covers the cost of AI and machine learning adoption and employee upskilling will be helpful for businesses looking to build training datasets and carry out data analysis and testing. </p><p>Smaller companies will also appreciate support in upskilling and retraining employees in emerging technologies, including AI, to acquire the necessary capabilities to handle <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-identifies-six-generative-ai-risks-sets-up-foundation-to-guide-adoption/" >new cyber threats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-operating-model-to-compete-in-ai-economy/"><strong>Businesses need a new operating model to compete in an AI-powered economy</strong></a></p><p>Organizations would further benefit from reskilling that can support their ESG development journey, which the government can provide through enhanced tax deductions for accredited training programs and tax subsidies. </p><p>The Singapore government can collaborate with sectoral agencies and trade associations to establish decarbonization industry roadmaps, with the aim of facilitating organizations’ transition to a greener ecosystem. </p><p>For instance, the report recommends that the Enterprise Financing Scheme - Green initiative is expanded to boost lending by eligible financial institutions and help smaller companies begin <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/singapore-firms-struggle-to-align-sustainability-goals-with-business-objectives/" >their sustainability journeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The report also calls for the establishment of data-sharing platforms to facilitate the exchange of ESG data, such as greenhouse gas emissions associated with certain activities. This process will enable businesses to carry out checks on internal data or make estimates when information is not available. </p><p>Furthermore, Singapore could look to calibrate its property tax policies to offer lower rates for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-wants-only-data-centres-that-are-efficient/" >green commercial and industrial buildings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which would motivate building owners to meet greener building requirements. </p><h4 id="Artificial-Intelligence"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence"></a>Artificial Intelligence</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-photoshops-new-text-to-image-as-good-as-midjourney-and-dall-e-we-test-it-and-see/"  title="Photoshop vs. Midjourney vs. DALL-E 3: Only one AI image generator passed my 5 tests">Photoshop vs. Midjourney vs. DALL-E 3: Only one AI image generator passed my 5 tests <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-powered-narrative-attacks-a-growing-threat-3-defense-strategies-for-business-leaders/"  title="AI-powered &#39;narrative attacks&#39; a growing threat: 3 defense strategies for business leaders">AI-powered ‘narrative attacks’ a growing threat: 3 defense strategies for business leaders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/copilot-pro-vs-chatgpt-plus-which-is-ai-chatbot-is-worth-your-20-a-month/"  title="Copilot Pro vs. ChatGPT Plus: Which AI chatbot is worth your $20 a month?">Copilot Pro vs. ChatGPT Plus: Which AI chatbot is worth your $20 a month?

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151893/7443" target="_top" id="2151893">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151893" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151893/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Apple-Unveils-Revolutionary-Passkey-Technology-at-WWDC-2022-ZDNet’s-Exclusive-Coverage"><a href="#Apple-Unveils-Revolutionary-Passkey-Technology-at-WWDC-2022-ZDNet’s-Exclusive-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="Apple Unveils Revolutionary Passkey Technology at WWDC 2022 - ZDNet’s Exclusive Coverage"></a>Apple Unveils Revolutionary Passkey Technology at WWDC 2022 - ZDNet’s Exclusive Coverage</h2><p>Apple announced today that it will be implementing its <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-make-a-new-commitment-for-a-passwordless-future/" >Passkey feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> across iOS and macOS devices, enabling users to manage accounts via biometric authentication. You’ll be able to use either Face ID or Touch ID to automatically fill in your log in information when accessing apps, websites, and programs on your iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or iMac device. </p><p>Passkeys can better protect your accounts from phishing scams or unauthorized access because they are encrypted, unlike passwords which can be cracked with specialized software or easily guessed with just a few extra bits of personal information. Apple also claims that Passkeys cannot be phished or leaked since they never leave the device they were created on. This means that hackers and scammers can’t trick you into sharing your Passkey with a fake log in portal or scrape your information from a remote server. </p><p>CNET</p><p>Apple also has plans for Passkeys to work across Android, Linux, and Windows platforms so you can use your iPhone or iPad to log into your accounts on non-iOS or non-macOS devices. That would make checking in at your doctor’s office or paying for grocery orders much faster, easier, and more secure. </p><h4 id="First-look-Apple’s-WWDC-2022-in-pictures"><a href="#First-look-Apple’s-WWDC-2022-in-pictures" class="headerlink" title="First look: Apple’s WWDC 2022 in pictures"></a>First look: Apple’s WWDC 2022 in pictures</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/1/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/2/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/3/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/4/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/5/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/6/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/7/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/8/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/9/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/10/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/11/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/12/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/13/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/14/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/15/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>◀ </p><p>But before you throw out all those sticky notes and unsubscribe from your <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" >password manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, developers still need time to integrate Passkeys into their websites, programs, and applications. And once they do, you’ll be able to use one Passkey across all of your devices and accounts for faster, more secure log-ins. You’ll have to use each device at least once to access your accounts when setting up your Passkey, but when you have everything configured and integrated, your Passkey will allow you to seamlessly switch between your devices and public terminals as support becomes more widespread. </p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-feature-apple-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-mac-and-more-this-fall-including-ai/"  title="Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more">Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/"  title="What is &#39;Apple Intelligence&#39;: How it works with on-device and cloud-based AI">What is ‘Apple Intelligence’: How it works with on-device and cloud-based AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-update-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-new-ai-features-for-now/"  title="Here&#39;s every iPhone model that will support Apple&#39;s new AI features (for now)">Here’s every iPhone model that will support Apple’s new AI features (for now) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-lastpass-apple-unveils-passwords-manager-app-at-wwdc-2024/"  title="Forget LastPass: Apple unveils &#39;Passwords&#39; manager app at WWDC 2024">Forget LastPass: Apple unveils ‘Passwords’ manager app at WWDC 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-feature-apple-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-mac-and-more-this-fall-including-ai/"  title="Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more">Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/"  title="What is &#39;Apple Intelligence&#39;: How it works with on-device and cloud-based AI">What is ‘Apple Intelligence’: How it works with on-device and cloud-based AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-update-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-new-ai-features-for-now/"  title="Here&#39;s every iPhone model that will support Apple&#39;s new AI features (for now)">Here’s every iPhone model that will support Apple’s new AI features (for now) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-lastpass-apple-unveils-passwords-manager-app-at-wwdc-2024/"  title="Forget LastPass: Apple unveils &#39;Passwords&#39; manager app at WWDC 2024">Forget LastPass: Apple unveils ‘Passwords’ manager app at WWDC 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-vives-motion-induced-woes-here-are-fixes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Vive's Motion-Induced Woes?

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129740/7443" target="_top" id="2129740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Do people dread a particular UI&#x2F;UX, or do they find it a positive encounter? For too long, too many applications, particularly in enterprises, have had terrible UI&#x2F;UX. Mobile interfaces have improved things, but with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" >artificial intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (AI) stealing the limelight, UI&#x2F;UX is getting <em>really</em> interesting. </p><p>With AI – particularly <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >generative AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Gen AI) and its natural language processing – accessing and integrating services and data may be a simple verbal prompt away. Plus, there are other ways in which AI will alter UI&#x2F;UX, such as providing guidance for interface design up front, rapid prototyping, and facilitating real-time feedback on user preferences.</p><p>“I can see very soon you’re no longer logging into enterprise applications. It’s just a new type of interface,” <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjoiner/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjoiner/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Andy%20Joiner%22%7D" >Andy Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, CEO of Hyperscience, told ZDNET. “You just may ask it, ‘What’s been the trend of customer satisfaction in the last few days, and how often are incident reports?’ And it just generates a nice summary. You can just go and have a conversation.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gemini-live-is-finally-available-heres-how-you-can-access-it-and-why-youll-want-to/" >Gemini Live is finally available. Here’s how you can access it (and why you’ll want to) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To this day, applications are point-and-click interfaces – which were revolutionary 35 years ago as they replaced “green-screen” text-based interfaces. Now, a new way to interact with machines is emerging. </p><p>“One would have to drill down into the applications to produce summaries themselves,” Joiner continued. “I think enterprise software is going to change forever. We will no longer interact with screens, buttons, and paths. With generative AI, you will work with a new type of experience, providing a very different type of design as we go forward.” </p><p>Excitement is brewing across the industry as this new way of interacting with systems emerges. “The UI&#x2F;UX design phase has often been a Jira-filled, time-consuming process comprised of iterations, compromises, and, ultimately, a disconnect between the designer’s vision and the developer’s execution,” <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferhli/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferhli/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Jennifer%20Li%22%7D" >Jennifer Li <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://a16z.com/author/yoko-li/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://a16z.com/author/yoko-li/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Yoko%20Li%22%7D" >Yoko Li <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, partners with Andreessen Horowitz, noted in a recent <a class="link"   href="https://a16z.com/how-generative-ai-is-remaking-ui-ux-design/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://a16z.com/how-generative-ai-is-remaking-ui-ux-design/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22post%22%7D" >post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-ai-for-coding/" >The best AI for coding in 2024 (and what not to use) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“Anyone who’s touched Salesforce or NetSuite, for example, is familiar with the endless tabs and fields,” Li and Li pointed out. “And they’re crowding the screen more as the workflow becomes more complex. It’s not an exaggeration to say most enterprise software is a reflection of the underlying database schema, and each read and write requires its own screen asset.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>An interface made adaptive to user intentions through generative AI “could become [a] just-in-time composition of components through a simple prompt, or inferred from prior actions, rather than navigating through nested menus and fields,” Li and Li continued. “In a context-aware CRM, where the user prompts ‘input an opportunity for a lead,’ the UI could pre-select answers and redact unnecessary fields to make the workflow more streamlined.” </p><p>Call it “GenAI-first UX,” a term coined by <a class="link"   href="https://minglabs.com/about/leadership/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://minglabs.com/about/leadership/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Marc%20Seefelder%22%7D" >Marc Seefelder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, co-founder and chief creative officer at Ming Labs, in a recent Medium <a class="link"   href="https://uxdesign.cc/transforming-ux-with-generative-ai-7b06ea329286#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://uxdesign.cc/transforming-ux-with-generative-ai-7b06ea329286%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22post%22%7D" >post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. “Imagine transitioning from rigid, linear user flows to flexible, intuitive experiences,” he stated. “This matters because it’s about making technology work for us, seamlessly blending with our human aspirations, and transforming digital experiences into something truly personalized and user-centric.” </p><p>Even when designing more traditional point-and-click screens, AI can make a difference by boosting the quality of user experiences. “AI-powered analytics tools can detect patterns in user behavior and automatically flag problematic areas in the design, such as high navigation times, difficulty using specific buttons, or frequent error messages,” states a tutorial <a class="link"   href="https://www.itmagination.com/blog/revolutionizing-user-interface-design-how-ai-is-elevating-the-ui-game#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.itmagination.com/blog/revolutionizing-user-interface-design-how-ai-is-elevating-the-ui-game%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22posted%22%7D" >posted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at ITmagination. “These insights enable designers to spot the inconsistencies and fix them promptly, ensuring a smoother user experience.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/welcome-to-the-ai-revolution-from-horsepower-to-manpower-to-machine-power/" >Welcome to the AI revolution: From horsepower to manpower to machine-power <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Application developers and designers “spend a lot of time and energy filling in the gaps between what’s on the screen and what’s implemented in code,” Li and Li note. “The problem is exacerbated when the app has complex states and edge cases because it’s a huge undertaking for a designer to enumerate all the possibilities through screenshots. As a result, most of the issues are only caught during QA and testing and require backtracking in several stages to fix. But because GenAI technology is uniquely fit for quick prototyping and code completion, we believe it can bridge a lot of the gaps in this iteration process.” </p><p>Looking at UI&#x2F;UX possibilities from another perspective, interfaces may need to be designed to help frame prompts with GenAI. “Prompt controls can increase the discoverability of GenAI chatbots’ features, offer inspiration, and minimize manual user input,” <a class="link"
