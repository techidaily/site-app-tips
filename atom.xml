Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902309/19272" target="_top" id="1902309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902309/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

In a blog post, 1Password product director Mitch Cohen announced the <a class="link"   href="https://blog.1password.com/unlock-1password-individual-passkey-beta/" >expansion of the passkey beta program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from private to public. This means that anyone creating a new individual account can secure it with a passkey instead of a master password or secret key.</p><p>However, Cohen noted, “the ability to unlock 1Password with a passkey is currently for new accounts only. Next year, we’ll make this feature available to anyone with an existing 1Password account.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" >The best password managers to save you from login hassle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Password managers have long been considered a convenient and secure way to protect all of your website accounts. However, securing your access typically requires a master password or secret key. Make that password too long and complex, and it’s a hassle to remember and use it. Make it too simple, and you’re inviting hackers to figure it out.</p><p>The passkey method, now <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/dashlane-launches-passwordless-login-for-new-users-only-so-far/" >gaining traction among more companies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, offers a safer and easier way to safeguard your account and all your login credentials.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In his post, Cohen explained how passkeys work in general and with 1Password. Passkeys take advantage of a security technology called <a class="link"   href="https://blog.1password.com/what-is-public-key-cryptography/" >public-key cryptography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. As such, every passkey contains two aspects: a private key and a public key.</p><p>When setting up a 1Password account with a passkey, the private key is kept secure and encrypted and never shared with 1Password itself. The public key is stored on the company’s servers and is used to authenticate your login attempts. But that public key is of no use without the corresponding private key. So even if the bad guys hacked into 1Password’s servers and somehow gained access to the key, they wouldn’t be able to sign into your account.</p><p>The ability to unlock 1Password with a passkey is currently for new accounts only. Next year, we’ll make this feature available to anyone with an existing 1Password account. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/dashlane-launches-passwordless-login-for-new-users-only-so-far/" >Dashlane launches passwordless login - for new users only so far <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To set up a 1Password account with a passkey, download and install the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id1511601750" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepassword.android&hl=en" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. Open the app and browse to the <a class="link"   href="https://1password.com/sign-up/passkey-preview" >sign-up page for the public beta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Start setting up your account. At some point, you’ll be prompted to create your passkey.</p><p>When asked to enter an email address, pick one that isn’t already connected to a 1Password account. You should then be prompted to create your passkey, which you can save to iCloud Keychain on an iPhone and Google Password Manager on an Android device. </p><p>To access 1Password on a different device, open the app or head to the <a class="link"   href="https://my.1password.com/signin?a=new" >sign-in page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Follow the steps to <a class="link"   href="https://support.1password.com/add-account/#add-another-account-to-the-1password-apps" >add another account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose the option to sign in with passkey. Enter your email address and again select the option to Sign in with passkey. You may need to use a QR code on your device or authenticate it with a passcode or facial or fingerprint recognition. You’ll receive a verification code that you then enter on your other device.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/passkeys-what-are-they-and-how-to-get-started/" >What are passkeys?

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135368/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798165/11305" target="_top" id="798165">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798165" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798165/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor.

The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148641/16836" target="_top" id="2148641">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148641" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="254" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148641/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902319/19272" target="_top" id="1902319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902319/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

This makes it the best value plan for teams that want to keep their sensitive data secure and protected.</p><p>1Password integrates with Azure Active Directory and Okta for easy deployment, and offers Advanced Protection with security features such as firewall rules, failed access reports, master password policy, two-factor authentication, and the ability to enforce security policies. The main difference between the Teams Starter Pack and the Business plan is that, with Teams, you don’t get single-sign-on (SSO), and document storage per user is capped to 1GB. Guest accounts are also limited to 5. </p><p>The Business plan also unlocks custom roles, security controls, and business-wide insights and reports. Still, if you’re part of a smaller team and don’t need all those features and fine-grain controls, the Teams Starter Pack might be better. It gets you unlimited shared vaults and passwords, admin controls, two-factor authentication, and 24&#x2F;7 email support.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-get-1Password-Teams-Starter-Pack"><a href="#How-to-get-1Password-Teams-Starter-Pack" class="headerlink" title="How to get 1Password Teams Starter Pack"></a><strong>How to get 1Password Teams Starter Pack</strong></h2><p>To get the $19.95-per-month offer on the Teams Starter Pack, click the button below.

Read now</a></p><p>The breach involves the information of 750,000 patients and 522 current and former OAG employees. </p><p>In a statement, the company said it was contacted by the FBI on October 21. The FBI explained that it seized an account that contained OAG patient and employee files from <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-new-malware-highlights-widespread-adoption-of-golang-language-by-cyberattackers/" >HelloKitty <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a Ukrainian ransomware group. </p><p>The FBI said it believes the group exploited a vulnerability in OAG’s third-party firewall, enabling the hackers to gain entry to the network. </p><p>“Patient information potentially involved in this incident included names, addresses, date(s) of service, diagnosis and procedure codes with descriptions, medical record numbers, insurance provider names, and insurance ID numbers,” OAG explained. </p><p>“The cybercriminals also potentially accessed current and former OAG employee data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and other details from W-2 forms on file.”</p><p>The July 11 attack locked OAG out of its servers and forced them to restore their systems from off-site backups and rebuild their IT infrastructure from the ground up. Outside cybersecurity experts were hired to help with the investigation into the attack. </p><p>“According to the cyber forensics report obtained by OAG in late November, the cybercriminals, once inside, were able to data-mine the administrator’s credentials and access OAG’s encrypted data,” OAG said.</p><p>The company has since replaced its third-party firewall and expanded the use of multifactor authentication. Victims of the incident are being provided with 12 months of Experian identity protection services and credit monitoring. </p><p>OAG added that victims should be on the lookout for scams and urged them to enroll in Experian’s IdentityWorks program, which comes with up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.</p><p>Those whose social security numbers were leaked are urged to create a mySocial Security account with the Social Security Administration, which will allow them to claim their SSN, according to OAG. </p><p><em>ZDNet</em> previously reported that the HelloKitty ransomware has been active since at least 2020 and mostly targets Windows systems, with some variants being used <a class="link"   href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-version-of-hellokitty-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/" >against Linux systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>There have been a number of HelloKitty spinoffs, including a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-new-malware-highlights-widespread-adoption-of-golang-language-by-cyberattackers/" >new unnamed ransomware variant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-groups-continue-assault-on-healthcare-orgs-as-covid-19-infections-increase/" >Vice Society <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The FBI <a class="link"   href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211029.pdf" >sent out a warning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> about the group in October, noting that the group was becoming known for aggressively pressuring its victims with the double extortion technique. </p><p>“In some cases, if the victim does not respond quickly or does not pay the ransom, the threat actors will launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on the victim company’s public facing website,” the FBI said. “Hello Kitty&#x2F;FiveHands actors demand varying ransom payments in Bitcoin (BTC) that appear tailored to each victim, commensurate with their assessed ability to pay it. If no ransom is paid, the threat actors will post victim data to the Babuk site (payload.bin) or sell it to a third-party data broker.”</p><p>The FBI added that the group typically uses compromised credentials or known vulnerabilities in SonicWall products and once inside the network, they will use publicly available penetration tool suites such as Cobalt Strike, Mandiant’s Commando, or PowerShell Empire preloaded with publicly available tools like Bloodhound and Mimikatz to map the network and escalate privileges before exfiltration and encryption. </p><p>In February, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cd-projekt-red-game-studio-discloses-ransomware-attack-extortion-attempt/" >group was implicated <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770544">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770544">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770544%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770544/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043603/7443" target="_top" id="2043603">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043603" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043603/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Credentials remain the highest targeted data type as they are the gateway to ransomware and data theft. 61% of data breaches in 2021 involved the use of stolen and misused credentials. Bad actors took advantage of a global pandemic to increase the number of phishing attacks, the cause of stolen credentials in 36% of breaches – a 9% increase over last year – according to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2021-data-breach-investigations-report.pdfx" >Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-security-key/" >The best security key While robust passwords help you secure your valuable online accounts, hardware-based two-factor authentication takes that security to the next level.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>We know one of the best ways to protect corporate data is to require multi-factor authentication (MFA). The use of MFA is expanding, more than 50% of enterprises provide an option to use MFA, and, according to <a class="link"   href="https://www.yubico.com/blog/75-of-enterprise-security-managers-plan-to-increase-mfa-spending-according-to-new-study-by-yubico-and-451-research/" >Yubico and 451 Research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, over 74% of organizations say they are increasing investment in MFA solutions. </p><p>Major platforms, such as Salesforce, announced that all logins to their platform will <a class="link"   href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000356005&type=1" >require MFA in February 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and organizations like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.irs.gov/privacy-disclosure/multi-factor-authentication-implementation" >IRS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have taken a strong stance on the requirement for MFA. Every platform should follow suit, and companies that command a premium to offer MFA should be publicly shamed (see the <a class="link"   href="https://sso.tax/" >SSO Wall of Shame <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) into making this a core part of all of their offerings. While the increasing adoption and additional spending are good trends to see, progress has been too slow.</p><p>To improve overall corporate security, enterprises should be actively educating and providing tools for employees to follow these same practices in their personal lives. When we attach the word corporate to security we’re letting employees off the hook. We’re sending the message that at work you have to follow secure processes – implying that at home they have no such requirement.</p><p>In August 2020, <a class="link"   href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/reports/2020/08/20-percent-of-organizations-experienced-breach-due-to-remote-worker-labs-report-reveals/" >MalwareBytes Labs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reported 20% of organizations experienced breaches due to remote workers. This number is likely underreported given the rapid increase in remote workers and the length of time the pandemic has impacted the workforce. Equally alarming, employees themselves are overconfident in their likelihood to be the cause of a breach. 61% of respondents in <a class="link"   href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210713005123/en/94-Of-Organizations-Have-Suffered-Insider-Data-Breaches-Egress-Research-Reveals" >Egress’ Insider Data Breach Survey for 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> answered that they felt they were equally or less likely to be the cause of a data breach while working from home.</p><p>The slow adoption of security best practices is often attributed to tool complexity and user experiences. We are all creatures of habit, and if we encourage the use of password managers, multi-factor authentication, and firewalls for personal use we would see the resistance decline for implementing these tools in the enterprise. </p><p>Given how connected we all are, the rising demands of working anywhere, and increasingly savvy bad actors who capitalize on a remote workforce, enterprises can no longer contain their efforts to the office space and ignore the home environment. The costs for education and licensing that support employees at home is a small investment that will pay big dividends in increased security at work and provide a boon for protecting employee personal data.</p><h4 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://app-tips.techidaily.com/advancing-your-skills-beyond-ai-explore-cutting-edge-career-opportunemail-protected/"><u>Advancing Your Skills Beyond AI -

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134498/18498" target="_top" id="2134498">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134498" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134498/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11.

But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075483/7443" target="_top" id="2075483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies.

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997675/19272" target="_top" id="1997675">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997675" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997675/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11.

But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144272/7443" target="_top" id="2144272">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144272" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144272/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948909/19272" target="_top" id="1948909">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948909" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948909/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094482/7443" target="_top" id="2094482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor.

The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Why? Because I’ve watched as so many people get their accounts hacked or their identities stolen and it’s no fun to see your friends and family struggle through such an ordeal.</p><p>To that end, I strive to add every layer of security I can. One very simple layer I take advantage of lies within the <a class="link"   href="https://bitwarden.com/" >Bitwarden password manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This open-source tool has quite a good number of features that not only make Bitwarden more useful but also more secure.</p><p>One such feature is the password re-prompt. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" >The best password managers of 2023 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Let me explain this feature by way of a scenario. </p><p>You’ve unlocked your Bitwarden vault and opened an item. You copy the password and then paste it into a login prompt. You then step away from your desk for a moment, forgetting to either close or lock Bitwarden. Some nefarious ne’er-do-well sidles up to your desk, sees Bitwarden open, clicks the eye icon to view your password, writes it down, and walks off. That person can now log into whatever account you have visible in Bitwarden.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You don’t want that.</p><p>Now, if that vault entry had the password prompt option enabled, when the scoundrel clicked the eye icon to view the password, they’d be prompted to type your Bitwarden master password before the password in question was revealed.</p><p>To sum it up, with the password re-prompt option enabled, any time anyone (including yourself) wanted to view a password, that person would have to type your vault master password a second time.</p><p>Yes, it’s yet another step to access that password, but that added layer of security can keep your accounts from being accessed by anyone but you.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-bitwarden-send-and-when-you-should/" >How to use Bitwarden Send (and when you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The other silver lining is that the password re-prompt is required when just copying a password. </p><p>A couple of things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>The password re-prompt doesn’t prevent someone from copying the password and pasting it in clear text anywhere else.</li><li>The password re-prompt can be enabled on either new entries or existing entries.</li></ul><p>Because the password re-prompt doesn’t prevent copying the password, it’s not a perfect solution. That means, of course, they could copy the password, open an email client, paste it into an email, and send it to themselves. Or, they could simply paste the password into a document and view it in plain text. Even so, it will prevent other people from viewing your passwords. So, it may not be ideal but it’s still an extra step I would suggest you enable (especially for important passwords, such as bank account information).</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-send-password-protected-emails-in-gmail/" >How to send password-protected emails in Gmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With that said, how do you enable the password re-prompt?

On a PC running Windows or Linux, on a Mac running MacOS, or on a mobile device, you install an app that manages a database containing sets of credentials (usernames, passwords, and other required details). The contents of the database are protected with AES-256 encryption. To unlock the password database, you enter a decryption key (your master password) that only you know, and then allow the program to fill in the saved credentials so you can sign in on a webpage or app. </p><p>As an alternative, you can use the built-in password management tools built into your browser. (For a full discussion, see <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-it-ok-to-use-your-browsers-built-in-password-manager/" >Password managers: Is it OK to use your browser’s built-in password management tools? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>) Architecturally, these designs are similar to third-party tools, except that they’re designed to work in a single browser ecosystem. They’re an adequate choice (and certainly better than nothing!), but third-party solutions are more robust. </p><p>Password managers that sync your password database to the cloud use end-to-end encryption. The data is encrypted before it leaves your device, and it stays encrypted as it’s transferred to the remote server. When you sign in to the app on your local device, the program sends a one-way hash of the password that identifies you but can’t be used to unlock the file itself. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-nearly-50-of-organizations-are-failing-at-password-security/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><strong>Why nearly 50% of organizations are failing at password security</strong></a> <strong>TechRepublic</strong> </p><p>The companies that manage and sync those saved files don’t have access to the decryption keys. In fact, if the developers have done their job properly, your master password isn’t stored anywhere. It’s your job to safeguard that secret, and if you forget the decryption key, you’re out of luck. Even with the most powerful computing resources, there’s <a class="link"   href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/52633/is-there-a-practical-way-to-crack-an-aes-encryption-password" >no practical way to crack an AES-256 encrypted file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that’s protected with a strong personal key. </p><p>That architecture offers five distinct advantages over a DIY solution. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/" >Best VPN services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-security-key/" >Best security keys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/" >Best antivirus software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fastest-vpn/" >The fastest VPNs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115932/19272" target="_top" id="2115932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Browser-Integration"><a href="#1-Browser-Integration" class="headerlink" title="1) Browser Integration"></a>1) Browser Integration</h3><p>Most password managers include browser extensions that automatically prompt you to save credentials when you create a new account or sign in using those credentials for the first time on a device. That browser integration also allows you to automatically enter credentials when you visit a matching website and to update the saved credentials when you change your password.</p><p>Contrast that approach with the inevitable friction of a manual list. You don’t need to find a file and add a password to it to save a new or changed set of credentials, and you don’t need to find and open that same file to copy and paste your password. </p><h3 id="2-Password-Generation"><a href="#2-Password-Generation" class="headerlink" title="2) Password Generation"></a>2) Password Generation</h3><p>Every password manager worth its salted hash includes a password generator capable of instantly producing a truly random, never-before-used-by-you password. If you don’t like that password, you can click to generate another. You can then use that random password when creating a new account or changing credentials for an existing one. </p><p>Most password managers also allow you to customize the length and complexity of a generated password so you can deal with sites that have peculiar password rules. </p><p>With the possible exceptions of <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%5FBeautiful%5FMind%5F%28film%29" >John Forbes Nash, Jr. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain%5FMan" >Raymond Babbitt <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, mere mortals are not capable of such feats of randomization. </p><h3 id="3-Phishing-Protection"><a href="#3-Phishing-Protection" class="headerlink" title="3) Phishing Protection"></a>3) Phishing Protection</h3><p>Integrating a password manager with a browser is superb protection against phishing sites. If you visit a site that has managed to perfectly duplicate your bank’s login page and even mess with the URL display to make it look legit, you might be fooled. Your password manager, on the other hand, won’t enter your saved credentials, because the URL of the fake site doesn’t match the legitimate domain associated with them. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-releases-chrome-extension-to-check-for-leaked-usernames-and-passwords/"><strong>Google releases Chrome extension to check for leaked usernames and passwords</strong></a></p><p>That phishing protection is probably the most underrated feature of all. If you manage passwords manually, by copying and pasting from an encrypted personal file, you will paste your username and password into the respective fields on that well-designed fake page, because you don’t realize it’s fake. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094479/7443" target="_top" id="2094479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094479/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Cross-Platform-Access"><a href="#4-Cross-Platform-Access" class="headerlink" title="4) Cross Platform Access"></a>4) Cross Platform Access</h3><p>Password managers work across devices, including PCs, Macs, and mobile devices, with the option to sync your encrypted password database to the cloud. Access to that file and its contents can be secured with biometric authentication and 2FA. </p><p>By contrast, if you manage passwords in an encrypted file that’s saved locally, you have to manually copy that file to other devices (or keep it in the cloud in a location under your personal control), and then make sure the contents of each copy stay in sync. More friction. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Surveillance-Safeguard"><a href="#5-Surveillance-Safeguard" class="headerlink" title="5) Surveillance Safeguard"></a>5) Surveillance Safeguard</h3><p>Password managers generally offer good protection against “shoulder surfing.” An attacker who’s able to watch you type, either live or with the help of a surveillance camera, can steal your login credentials with ease. Password managers never expose those details. </p><h2 id="Is-there-a-case-against-password-managers"><a href="#Is-there-a-case-against-password-managers" class="headerlink" title="Is there a case against password managers?"></a>Is there a case against password managers?</h2><p>Even armed with those arguments, when I make that recommendation to other people, I typically hear the same excuses. Honestly, though, none of them hold up to scrutiny.</p><p><strong>“I already have a perfectly good system for managing passwords.”</strong></p><p>Usually, this system involves reusing an easy-to-remember base password of some sort, tacking on a special suffix or prefix attached to that base on a per-site basis. The trouble with that scheme is that those passwords aren’t random, and if someone figures out your pattern, they pretty much have a skeleton key to unlock everything. And a 2013 research paper from computer scientists at the University of Illinois, Princeton, and Indiana University, <a class="link"   href="http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/DBCBW14-NDSS-tangled%5Fweb.pdf" >The Tangled Web of Password Reuse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, demonstrated that attackers can <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/if-you-think-just-because-you-use-different-passwords-for-different-services-youre-safe-think-again/" >figure out those patterns very, very quickly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>More importantly, this sort of scheme doesn’t scale. Eventually it collides with the password rules at a site that, say, doesn’t allow special characters or restricts password length. (I know, that’s nuts, but those sites exist.) Or a service forces you to change your password and won’t accept your new password because it’s too close to the previous one and now you have another exception to your system that you have to keep track of. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-manage-your-passwords-effectively-with-keepass/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><strong>How to manage your passwords effectively with KeePass</strong></a> <strong>TechRepublic</strong> </p><p>And so you wind up keeping an encrypted list of passwords that are not exactly unique and not exactly random, and not at all secure. Why not just use software built for this purpose? </p><p><strong>“If someone steals my password file, they have all my passwords.”</strong></p><p>No, they don’t. They have an AES-256 encrypted blob that is, for all intents and purposes, useless gibberish. The only way to extract its secrets is with the decryption key, which you and you alone know. </p><h3 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/" >The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/" >How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/" >The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/" >The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/" >How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Of course, this assumes you’ve followed some reasonable precautions with that decryption key. Specifically, that you’ve made it long enough, that it can’t be guessed even by someone who knows you well, and that you’ve never used it for anything else. And if you’ve enabled multi-factor authentication, you’ve given a password thief one more very large hurdle to get over.</p><p>If you need a strong and unique password, you can generate one at <a class="link"   href="http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net/" >correcthorsebatterystaple.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which uses the surprisingly secure methodology from <a class="link"   href="https://xkcd.com/936/" >this classic XKCD cartoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

But you might want to write down that password and store it in a very safe place or with a very trusted person, along with instructions for how to use it to unlock your password file in the event something happens to you. </p><p><strong>“I don’t trust someone else to store my passwords on their server.”</strong></p><p>I understand the instinctive reaction that allowing a cloud service to keep your full database of passwords must be a horrifying security risk. Like anything cloud-related, there’s a trade-off between convenience and security, but that risk is relatively low if the service follows best practices for encryption and you’ve set a strong master password. </p><p>But if you just don’t trust the cloud, you have alternatives. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/57-of-it-workers-who-get-phished-dont-change-their-password-behaviors/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><strong>57% of IT workers who get phished don’t change their password behaviors</strong></a> <strong>TechRepublic</strong> </p><p>Several of the password managers I’ve looked at offer the option to store a local-only copy of your AES-256 encrypted file, with no sync features whatsoever. If you choose that option, you’ll have to either forgo the option to use your password manager on multiple sites or devise a way to manually sync those files between different devices. </p><p>As a middle ground, you can use a personal cloud service to sync your password files. 1Password, for example, supports automatic syncing to both Dropbox and iCloud, ensuring that you’re protected even if one of those services is compromised.</p><p><strong>“I’m not a target.”</strong></p><p>Yes, you are. </p><p>If you’re a journalist working on security issues, or an activist in a country whose leaders don’t approve of activism, or a staffer on a high-profile political campaign, or a contractor that communicates with people in sensitive industries, you’re a high-value target. Anyone who fits in one of those categories should take opsec seriously, and a password manager is an essential part of a well-layered security program. </p><p>But even if you’re not an obvious candidate for targeted attacks, you can be swept up in a website breach. That’s why <a class="link"   href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" >Have I Been Pwned? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> exists. It’s easy enough for a compromised website to force you to reset your password, minimizing the risk of that breach, but if you’ve used that same combination of credentials elsewhere, you’re at serious risk.

They said the severity is “high” and gave it a CVSS score of 7.5. </p><p>“Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, ${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process. This is also known as a DOS (Denial of Service) attack,” Apache explained. </p><p>They added that the latest issue was discovered by Akamai Technologies’ Hideki Okamoto and an anonymous vulnerability researcher. </p><p>Mitigations include applying the 2.17.0 patch and replacing Context Lookups like ${ctx:loginId} or ${ctx:loginId} with Thread Context Map patterns (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) in PatternLayout in the logging configuration. Apache also suggested removing references to Context Lookups in the the configuration like ${ctx:loginId} or ${ctx:loginId} where they originate from sources external to the application such as HTTP headers or user input. </p><p>They noted that only the Log4j-core JAR file is impacted by CVE-2021-45105. </p><p>On Friday, security researchers online began <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1471943986705281029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1471943986705281029%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/upgraded-to-log4j-216-surprise-theres-a-217-fixing-dos/" >tweeting about potential issues <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with 2.16.0, with some <a class="link"   href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3230" >identifying the denial of service vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Discussion about Log4j has dominated conversation all week. CISA <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cisa-orders-federal-agencies-to-mitigate-log4j-vulnerabilities-in-emergency-directive/" >released multiple advisories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> mandating federal civilian agencies in the US <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cisa-orders-federal-civilian-agencies-to-patch-log4j-vulnerability-by-december-24/" >apply patches before Christmas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/vmware-patches-critical-non-log4j-flaw-as-ibm-cisco-release-log4j-fixes/" >several major tech companies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like IBM, Cisco and VMware have raced to address Log4j vulnerabilities in their products. </p><p>Security company Blumira claims to have found a <a class="link"   href="https://www.blumira.com/analysis-log4shell-local-trigger/" >new Log4j attack vector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can be exploited through the path of a listening server on a machine or local network, potentially putting an end to the assumption that the problem was limited to exposed vulnerable servers. </p><p>Other cybersecurity firms have found that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/conti-ransomware-attacking-vmware-vcenter-servers-through-log4j-vulnerability/" >major ransomware groups like Conti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are exploring ways to take advantage of the vulnerability. </p><p>Google <a class="link"   href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/12/understanding-impact-of-apache-log4j.html" >released a security report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Friday where Open Source Insights Team members James Wetter and Nicky Ringland said they found that 35,863 of the available Java artifacts from Maven Central depend on the affected Log4j code. This means that more than 8% of all packages on Maven Central have at least one version that is impacted by this vulnerability, the two explained. </p><p>“The average ecosystem impact of advisories affecting Maven Central is 2%, with the median less than 0.1%,” Wetter and Ringland said. </p><p>So far, nearly 5,000 artifacts have been patched, leaving more than 30,000 more. But the two noted that it will be difficult to address the issue because of how deep Log4j is embedded in some products. </p><p>Google</p><p>“Most artifacts that depend on log4j do so indirectly. The deeper the vulnerability is in a dependency chain, the more steps are required for it to be fixed. For greater than 80% of the packages, the vulnerability is more than one level deep, with a majority affected five levels down (and some as many as nine levels down),” Wetter and Ringland wrote. </p><p>**”**These packages will require fixes throughout all parts of the tree, starting from the deepest dependencies first.” </p><p>The two went on to say that after looking at all publicly disclosed critical advisories affecting Maven packages, they found less than half (48%) of the artifacts affected by a vulnerability have been fixed, meaning it may take years for the Log4j issue to be solved. </p><h4 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN
