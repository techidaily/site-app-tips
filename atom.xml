If you can rattle off that password without thinking, chances are pretty good it’s not nearly strong enough. Any password you can memorize (unless you have an amazing memory) is probably weak. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" >The best password manager: Business and personal use Everyone needs a password manager. If you’re willing to pay a monthly or annual fee, these options are worth it.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Whether you like it or not, it’s way past time you stopped using passwords like password, 12345, qwerty, 111111, 000000, iloveyou, 666666, qwertyuiop, dragon, monkey, or qazwsx. Believe it or not, that list comes from the <a class="link"   href="https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/" >Nordpass most common password list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That’s right, even with password breaches and massive service hacks becoming the norm, people are still using such simplistic passwords.</p><p>I get it, I really do. We’re all so busy we don’t have time to add yet another complication to our daily workflow.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lastpass-vs-1password/"><strong>LastPass vs 1Password: Battle of the password manager titans</strong></a></p><p>But let me ask you a very simple question: Do you really want to prevent bad actors from accessing your accounts and services? The answer should be a resounding, “Yes!” otherwise your approach to security is not in line with modern existence.</p><p>You might think that to be hyperbole but it’s not. It’s 2022 and if you’re still using weak passwords, it’s only a matter of time before someone hacks any number of your accounts. </p><p>Consider this, according to <a class="link"   href="https://www.hivesystems.io/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green" >Hive Systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, if you use password as an account password, it only takes about 5 seconds to crack it. If your password is 12345678, it can be cracked instantly. If, however, that password is an 11 character combination of upper case, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, that password would take years to crack.</p><p>Of course, at this point, you’re thinking, “I don’t want to have to memorize a bunch of impossible passwords.” Good thing you don’t have to. In fact, when you employ a password manager, you only have to memorize one password. That one password will unlock a vault containing all of those passwords you’ve created and are next to impossible to memorize.</p><p>Let’s step back a bit.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-does-this-even-work"><a href="#How-does-this-even-work" class="headerlink" title="How does this even work?"></a>How does this even work?</h2><p>If you’re new to the world of password managers, let me explain to you how they work. Think of the password manager as a safe, where you can store all of your important bits. Those bits are individual entries for all of the accounts and services you use. You’d create an entry for:</p><ul><li>Your bank</li><li>Facebook</li><li>Twitter</li><li>Instagram</li><li>Tiktok</li><li>Amazon</li><li>Any work systems you use</li><li>Netflix</li><li>Hulu</li></ul><p>In other words, a password manager keeps all of your passwords locked away in a virtual safe and only you have the key to open it. That key is yet another password but it’s the only one you have to memorize. To make this even easier, if you’re using a password manager on your mobile device, you can set it up to unlock using either biometrics (such as a fingerprint or face scanner) or your phone password&#x2F;PIN. </p><p>Even better, most password managers include a feature called a random password generator. So when you’re setting up a new account, you don’t have to worry about creating a complicated, strong password. Instead, you let the password manager create the password for you. Using this feature ensures you will not only be using very strong passwords, but it helps keep you from reusing passwords from one site&#x2F;service to the next. With the help of a password manager, every site&#x2F;service you use will have its own strong and unique password.</p><p>If you want to keep your accounts from being hacked, that is the single most important first step you can take. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/1password-review/"><strong>1Password review: Pretty close to perfect</strong></a></p><p>But the fun doesn’t end there. With some password managers, you get browser integration which means you land on a site that requires a password, and the password manager (once you enter the vault unlock password) will auto-fill the credentials for you. The implications of that are important:</p><ul><li>You don’t have to have your browser save your password (which can be a security risk).</li><li>You get the added benefit of using very strong passwords.</li><li>You only have to type a single password for everything.</li></ul><p>At this point, you’re probably thinking, “But my web browser has a built-in password manager!” Although that’s true, those built-in password managers aren’t nearly as secure as a stand-alone password manager, nor do they include all the bells and whistles found within a good password manager. If you want the most secure browser experience, you won’t ever allow your browser to save your passwords, and you’ll instead use a password manager with browser integration.</p><p>Convinced yet? If not, let me spell it out for you in terms that will hopefully open your eyes to why a password manager is an absolute necessity these days:</p><p>If you don’t use one, eventually one or more of your accounts will get hacked.</p><p>It’s as simple as that.</p><p>So, what password managers should you consider?

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144277/7443" target="_top" id="2144277">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144277" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144277/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

So, how can technology leaders and line-of-business professionals step up to ensure responsible AI practices are in place? Here are some of the key guidelines <a class="link"   href="https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/" >shared <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Google’s AI team:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a human-centered design approach:</strong> “The way actual users experience your system is essential to assessing the true impact of its predictions, recommendations, and decisions. Design features with appropriate disclosures built-in: clarity and control is crucial to a good user experience. Model potential adverse feedback early in the design process, followed by specific live testing and iteration for a small fraction of traffic before full deployment.”</li><li><strong>Engage with a diverse set of users and use-case scenarios:</strong> “Incorporate feedback before and throughout project development. This will build a rich variety of user perspectives into the project and increase the number of people who benefit from the technology.”</li><li><strong>Design your model using concrete goals for fairness and inclusion:</strong> “Consider how the technology and its development over time will impact different use cases: Whose views are represented? What types of data are represented? What’s being left out?”</li><li><strong>Check the system for unfair biases:</strong> “For example, organize a pool of trusted, diverse testers who can adversarially test the system, and incorporate a variety of adversarial inputs into unit tests. This can help to identify who may experience unexpected adverse impacts. Even a low error rate can allow for the occasional very bad mistake.”</li><li><strong>Stress test the system on difficult cases:</strong> “This will enable you to quickly evaluate how well your system is doing on examples that can be particularly hurtful or problematic each time you update your system. As with all test sets, you should continuously update this set as your system evolves, features are added or removed and you have more feedback from users.”</li><li><strong>Test, test, test:</strong> “Learn from software engineering best test practices and quality engineering to make sure the AI system is working as intended and can be trusted. Conduct rigorous unit tests to test each component of the system in isolation. Conduct integration tests to understand how individual ML components interact with other parts of the overall system.”</li><li><strong>Use a gold standard dataset to test the system and ensure that it continues to behave as expected:</strong> “Update this test set regularly in line with changing users and use cases, and to reduce the likelihood of training on the test set. Conduct iterative user testing to incorporate a diverse set of users’ needs in the development cycles.”</li><li><strong>Apply the quality engineering principle of poka-yoke:</strong> “Build quality checks into a system, so that unintended failures either cannot happen or trigger an immediate response – e.g., if an important feature is unexpectedly missing, the AI system won’t output a prediction.”</li></ul><p>The business might want to implement AI quickly, but caution must be taken to ensure the tools and their models are accurate and fair. While businesses are looking for AI to advance, the technology must deliver responsible results every time. </p><h4 id="Artificial-Intelligence"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence"></a>Artificial Intelligence</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-photoshops-new-text-to-image-as-good-as-midjourney-and-dall-e-we-test-it-and-see/"  title="Photoshop vs. Midjourney vs. DALL-E 3: Only one AI image generator passed my 5 tests">Photoshop vs. Midjourney vs. DALL-E 3: Only one AI image generator passed my 5 tests <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-powered-narrative-attacks-a-growing-threat-3-defense-strategies-for-business-leaders/"  title="AI-powered &#39;narrative attacks&#39; a growing threat: 3 defense strategies for business leaders">AI-powered ‘narrative attacks’ a growing threat: 3 defense strategies for business leaders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/copilot-pro-vs-chatgpt-plus-which-is-ai-chatbot-is-worth-your-20-a-month/"  title="Copilot Pro vs. ChatGPT Plus: Which AI chatbot is worth your $20 a month?">Copilot Pro vs. ChatGPT Plus: Which AI chatbot is worth your $20 a month?

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151889/7443" target="_top" id="2151889">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151889/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023.

That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC?

On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948895/19272" target="_top" id="1948895">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948895" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948895/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows.

The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Choosing the right web hosting service for you can be challenging, but you no longer need to be a programmer or pay someone to build advanced features such as e-commerce or forum management to launch a website.</p><p>Today, many web providers offer these functions, as well as a content management system (CMS) and other features like SEO assistance and security checks, in standard subscription packages – and for an affordable price. </p><p>Below, you will find our top recommendations for web hosting services, ranging from providers that give you a quick and easy way to build your website all the way up to companies that provide full data center infrastructure capabilities as a service.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"><strong>The best VPNs</strong></a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-web-hosting-service-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-web-hosting-service-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best web hosting service right now?"></a>What is the best web hosting service right now?</h2><p>ZDNET has conducted extensive research and hands-on testing with many of the top web hosting services.

Hostinger offers inexpensive plans starting at only $2.99&#x2F;month, which is suitable for most website owners. Its premium plan has everything you need: a website builder, WordPress integration, templates, emails, SEO, marketing help, and more. </p><p>Read on for the rest of our picks for the best web hosting services in 2024.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135411/19272" target="_top" id="2135411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-web-hosting-services-of-2024"><a href="#Best-web-hosting-services-of-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best web hosting services of 2024"></a>Best web hosting services of 2024</h2><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.hostg.xyz/aff%5Fc?offer_id=701&aff_id=2693&url_id=3516&source=zdnet&aff_sub=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Hostinger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Inexpensive</li><li>One-click WordPress install</li><li>AI tools</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Enhanced security limited to more expensive plans</li><li>Prices jump on renewal</li></ul><h3 id="Hostinger"><a href="#Hostinger" class="headerlink" title="Hostinger"></a>Hostinger</h3><h4 id="Best-web-hosting-service-overall"><a href="#Best-web-hosting-service-overall" class="headerlink" title="Best web hosting service overall"></a>Best web hosting service overall</h4><p>Hostinger’s premium plan ($2.99&#x2F;month, three months free) is excellent value for the money if you want to operate multiple websites for personal or business reasons under one account.</p><p>The premium plan supports up to 100 websites. It offers users 100GB storage, up to 100 email addresses and forwarders, free SSL website security, and unlimited bandwidth, and a free domain name. </p><p>While there’s no dedicated IP address, this won’t bother most website owners. Furthermore, you’ll be given basic e-commerce capabilities and one-click WordPress installation and migration. The same WordPress installation can be used to support multiple WordPress websites. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hostinger-review-web-hosting/"><strong>Hostinger</strong></a></p><p>If you need a theme, Hostinger also provides a drag-and-drop website builder and 150 templates. The plan includes Google Analytics integration, SEO tools, and standard DDoS protection. </p><p>Overall, we consider Hostinger’s premium plan an excellent option for most website owners and small businesses. Business options begin at $2.99&#x2F;month with three months added, for free.</p><p>A downside, however, is that you can only access more advanced features – such as daily backups and increased performance – with more expensive subscriptions. In addition, while many customers applaud Hostinger’s customer service, there are reports of bounceback and slow loads by some clients operating multiple websites.</p><p>There is a limited, free plan available, with 300MB storage but no free domain or email.</p><p><strong>Hostinger features:</strong> <strong>cPanel</strong>: Yes | <strong>SSL</strong>: Some plans | <strong>SSH</strong>: Yes | <strong>Backups</strong>: Yes | <strong>Money-back guarantee</strong>: 30 days | <strong>Support</strong>: 24&#x2F;7, live chat support</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamhost.com/special-offers/" >View now at DreamHost <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Over three-month money-back guarantee</li><li>Many hosting options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Email an additional cost</li></ul><h3 id="DreamHost"><a href="#DreamHost" class="headerlink" title="DreamHost"></a>DreamHost</h3><h4 id="Best-web-hosting-service-for-professionals"><a href="#Best-web-hosting-service-for-professionals" class="headerlink" title="Best web hosting service for professionals"></a>Best web hosting service for professionals</h4><p>DreamHost’s easy-to-use interface, efficiency, and customer support stand out to business owners and new webmasters alike. The hosting provider offers WordPress hosting, shared hosting, virtual private servers, dedicated servers, cloud hosting, and more. </p><p>We particularly like that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dreamhost-review/" >DreamHost <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers G Suite integration, domain integration, and Google Cloud support. The company also provides a great set of resources and guides that can help customers grow their businesses cost-effectively.

Prices begin at $2.95 per month for a basic, shared plan, with email available for an additional monthly fee.</p><p><strong>DreamHost features</strong> <strong>:</strong> <strong>cPanel</strong>: No, proprietary panel | <strong>SSL</strong>: Free | <strong>SSH</strong>: Yes | <strong>Backups</strong>: Yes | <strong>Money-back guarantee</strong>: 97 days | <strong>Support</strong>: 24&#x2F;7 chat, ticket, and call-back</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ionos.com/hosting/web-hosting" >View now at Ionos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Scalable</li><li>Affordable plans</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Paid plans can become expensive following promotion time periods</li></ul><h3 id="Ionos"><a href="#Ionos" class="headerlink" title="Ionos"></a>Ionos</h3><h4 id="Best-budget-web-hosting-service"><a href="#Best-budget-web-hosting-service" class="headerlink" title="Best budget web hosting service"></a>Best budget web hosting service</h4><p>Ionos is one of our top picks for affordable, long-term web hosting. The web hosting provider offers reliable, stable uptime with daily backups included on all plans. Free wildcard SSL certificates, email, a free domain, and 24&#x2F;7 support are also included. </p><p>Customers report great customer service, uptime, easy setup, and web hosting transitions. </p><p>Basic plans supporting one website and with 10 databases, alongside 10GB storage space, are typically $6&#x2F;month, but with the agreement of a three-year plan, will cost you $4&#x2F;month. A free domain name for one year is included. </p><p>The top deal at the moment is for Ionos Plus, a website hosting package suitable for larger, scalable projects and WordPress. On a three-year plan, you will only pay $6&#x2F;month and you can operate unlimited websites with unlimited databases and storage. You will also receive a wildcard SSL certificate.</p><p><strong>Ionos f</strong> <strong>eatures:</strong> <strong>cPanel</strong>: Yes | <strong>SSL</strong>: Yes, wildcard | <strong>SSH</strong>: Yes | <strong>Backups</strong>: Daily | <strong>Money-back guarantee</strong>: 30 days | <strong>Support</strong>: 24&#x2F;7</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.a2hosting.com/?aid=cnet&bid=000a6faf&chan=zdnet" >View now at A2 Hosting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Positive customer reviews</li><li>Frequent sales promotions</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive dedicated server plans</li></ul><h3 id="A2-web-hosting"><a href="#A2-web-hosting" class="headerlink" title="A2 web hosting"></a>A2 web hosting</h3><h4 id="Best-web-hosting-service-for-beginners"><a href="#Best-web-hosting-service-for-beginners" class="headerlink" title="Best web hosting service for beginners"></a>Best web hosting service for beginners</h4><p>A2 is an excellent web hosting option for beginners who want to learn the ropes without spending a fortune. </p><p>A2 provides a 24&#x2F;7 customer team if you need help deciding on a plan. For only $1.95&#x2F;month, A2’s basic shared hosting Startup package includes one website, free migration, unlimited email accounts, ample storage (100GB), staging, and a website builder.</p><p>What we particularly like about this option is the potential to upgrade as your project grows, with extra speed, storage, and capacity available when you are ready. Turbo boost options, starting at $4.95&#x2F;month, offer unlimited websites, unlimited storage, and automatic backups.</p><p>Customers applaud the firm’s 24&#x2F;7 phone, email, and chat support, with assistance available during migration and beyond. </p><p><strong>A2 features:</strong> Multi-tier plans | 99.99% uptime commitment | Free SSL certificates | cPanel control | Money-back guarantee | Automatic backups | Turbo speed options | 24&#x2F;7 phone, email, live chat support</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.greengeeks.com/track/cnetwebhosting/cp-zdnet/lp-1?subid2=zdnetbesthosting&sid=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at GreenGeeks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Reasonably priced</li><li>Eco-friendly</li><li>Long MBG</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>On-demand backups limited to premium plans</li></ul><h3 id="GreenGeeks"><a href="#GreenGeeks" class="headerlink" title="GreenGeeks"></a>GreenGeeks</h3><h4 id="Best-web-hosting-service-for-the-environmentally-conscious"><a href="#Best-web-hosting-service-for-the-environmentally-conscious" class="headerlink" title="Best web hosting service for the environmentally-conscious"></a>Best web hosting service for the environmentally-conscious</h4><p>GreenGeeks is a great web hosting option if you want to sign up for a sustainable, eco-conscious service.</p><p>GreenGeeks has developed its marketing around the concept of being environmentally friendly, with three times the power your hosting demands replaced with wind power credits and tree planting. </p><p>It’s not just the environmental factor, however – GreenGeeks prides itself on a speedy, reliable service. Although the company’s own website could use some modernization and an overhaul, the important part is the hosting, which includes standard hosting, WordPress installs, commerce, VPS, and dedicated tiers. </p><p>Basic plans cost $2.95&#x2F;month, with options to upgrade and grow over time. The basic web hosting plan only covers one website with 50GB storage, but once you move up a level, you can expect support for unlimited websites, managed WordPress installs, unlimited space, a free SSL certificate, and more. </p><p>Customers applaud GreenGeeks’ customer service, although there are reports of “hidden” fees related to specific products.</p><p><strong>GreenGeeks f</strong> <strong>eatures:</strong> <strong>cPanel</strong>: Yes | <strong>SSL</strong>: Free | <strong>SSH</strong>: Yes | <strong>Backups</strong>: Varies by plan | <strong>Money-back guarantee</strong>: 30 days | <strong>Support</strong>: Depends on plan</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.godaddy.com/" >View now at GoDaddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Free, unlimited SSL for all websites on the Deluxe plan and up</li><li>Tutorials online to help guide your website-creating process</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Large payment down to start hosting</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="GoDaddy"><a href="#GoDaddy" class="headerlink" title="GoDaddy"></a>GoDaddy</h3><h4 id="Best-web-hosting-service-for-GoDaddy-domain-customers"><a href="#Best-web-hosting-service-for-GoDaddy-domain-customers" class="headerlink" title="Best web hosting service for GoDaddy domain customers"></a>Best web hosting service for GoDaddy domain customers</h4><p>GoDaddy has offered as wide an array of services as possible for individuals and small businesses needing an internet presence. It’s widely known, and many customers enjoy the service.</p><p>GoDaddy is a great option if you prefer to stick with a well-known brand. It’s also recently introduced AI-based services to help you find the right domain name and to assist you with branding. </p><p>Pricing begins at $5.99&#x2F;month for one website. Specific plans may qualify you for a free domain name and SSL certificate. Regarding security, automatic WordPress updates are applied, and malware scanning services are available. Each plan comes with a one-click WordPress installation, a cPanel, and daily backups. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/godaddy-websites-marketing-review/"><strong>GoDaddy</strong></a></p><p>Customer service is reasonable, and although not 24&#x2F;7, if you need a technical lead to get something accomplished, you can usually find someone with a clue (after jumping through a few hoops, of course). However, the refund policy is restrictive, and I would say the host’s website is cluttered, making it difficult to find exactly what service you need – and for what price.</p><p>ZDNET author David Gewirtz has decades of experience with GoDaddy, and he has come to respect how this web host provides the key services most customers want. They’re definitely not the best at anything, but they do a good job with almost everything. </p><p>“GoDaddy, in my opinion, is the best web host,” Gerrid Smith, director of E-commerce of <a class="link"   href="https://joyorganics.com/collections/creams" >Joy Organics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, told ZDNET. “They promise a minimum of 99.9% availability.

They are everywhere. With six million premium subscribers, they’ve got some momentum – and are certainly capable of grabbing attention.</p><p>When selecting a website builder, why would you go with Wix over WordPress? The answer is simplicity. WordPress offers tremendous depth and customization options with plugins and widgets, but Wix quickly gets you up and running with an attractive site. </p><p>There is nothing like the thousands of plugins and themes offered by WordPress in the Wix world, but if you want a well-designed site and you need an e-commerce solution, this is a great option. </p><p>I selected this provider when I assisted someone in setting up a small online business, and the learning curve was easy, with no payment or downtime issues. However, for someone used to CMS backends, the more restrictive website builder can be somewhat frustrating.</p><p>Free versions, however, do contain Wix banners. You can start there, and if you like the system, convert to a paid plan and link up your chosen domain name.

After all, your website could end up being the central hub of your business for promotion and customer communication, so constant downtime can harm your reputation.</li><li><strong>Affordability</strong>: Your budget must be based on the purpose of your web hosting package. Whether you want a single, small slice of hosting real estate for a personal blog or you want to run a large e-commerce store, it will change how much you should expect to pay. Set a budget you can easily afford and find the right provider to match you.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: You need to consider the most important functions or uses of your website. If you expect to grow your business over time and you expect heavy traffic, you will need to be able to scale the hosting’s capabilities over time. Choose a provider with upgrade options.</li><li><strong>Customer support</strong>: We find that customer support can be extremely important when you sign up for a web hosting service. Whether you are a beginner or want to run a plethora of websites, you should choose a provider with customer support options.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-web-hosting-services"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-web-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these web hosting services?"></a>How did we choose these web hosting services?</h2><p>When we compiled this list, we began with web hosts ZDNET authors are personally familiar with. ZDNET does extensive testing on and research into web hosting providers, taking into consideration user reviews, competitor analysis, personal usage and experiences, and more.</p><p>Some of us have been running production websites for decades, with sites that have served millions of pages. Others have used web hosts for personal blogs, writing projects, and to help individuals launch small businesses. </p><p>We chose these providers because we believe they offer some of the best services in the market. These are the main factors we considered:</p><ul><li><strong>Features offered</strong>: Deciding on the best web hosting provider for you requires you to consider what features are a priority. We’ve included options for CMS implementation, e-commerce, design services, SEO services, cybersecurity functions, and more.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: Naturally, the price point is a very important factor when we choose our web hosting provider recommendations. We have included options suitable for varying budgets, all the way from personal blogs to small businesses and large enterprise setups that will need to scale.</li><li><strong>Stability</strong>: We have included only reputable web hosting providers that provide stable services with minimal downtime. After all, there’s no point in having a speedy, responsive website if downtime is a constant problem.</li><li><strong>Customer experiences</strong>: If you are going to sign up for a long-term web hosting service, you need to know how the company treats and supports its customers. We have examined customer reviews and feedback.</li></ul><h2 id="Which-web-host-is-best-for-beginners"><a href="#Which-web-host-is-best-for-beginners" class="headerlink" title="Which web host is best for beginners?"></a>Which web host is best for beginners?</h2><p>Wix and Squarespace are the two web hosts we would recommend for beginners. With an abundance of creative templates between the two platforms, users can gain experience in web development with an attractive site. If you have experience with CMS platforms, you could look at WordPress.com.</p><h2 id="Can-you-get-web-hosting-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-get-web-hosting-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you get web hosting for free?"></a>Can you get web hosting for free?</h2><p>Yes. There are many sites that allow for free hosting, but to do so, you will have a generic, branded domain. For example, if you were to have a free WordPress website, your domain would be [yourwebsitename].wordpress.com. </p><p>Be careful, though. Many of the free offers end after a period of time and then you’re stuck on a service that will likely charge you a considerable additional fee to keep using it. Or, the website host may allow you to have a free website on the condition that you allow adverts to be displayed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132160/7443" target="_top" id="2132160">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132160" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132160/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Who-is-the-largest-web-hosting-company"><a href="#Who-is-the-largest-web-hosting-company" class="headerlink" title="Who is the largest web hosting company?"></a>Who is the largest web hosting company?</h2><p>GoDaddy is one of the most popular web hosting service providers.

About <a class="link"   href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" >63% of websites <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with content management systems use <a class="link"   href="https://wordpress.org/" >the open-source WordPress CMS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The WordPress ecosystem is huge, and finding the right WordPress host is a challenge on its own. Beyond WordPress.com, the service offered by the creators of the CMS, there are a large number of managed hosting providers and an even larger number of hosting providers that specialize in providing a WordPress-optimized server for your website. Nearly every hosting provider will allow a WordPress install, considering its popularity.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-best-Infrastructure-as-a-Service-providers"><a href="#What-are-the-best-Infrastructure-as-a-Service-providers" class="headerlink" title="What are the best Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers?"></a>What are the best Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers?</h2><p>Our recommendations include IaaS providers you probably know intimately, such as Amazon. They are highly credible vendors who’ve been providing infrastructure for years.</p><p>If you’re just starting, you might not want to go all-in with an IaaS provider, although they offer the most flexibility. Some, like Amazon and Digital Ocean, allow you to point-and-click configure virtual WordPress machines or almost any other open-source content management system you may want. It might be overkill for SMBs, though.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014857/22899" target="_top" id="2014857">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014857" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014857/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-best-point-and-click-website-builders"><a href="#What-are-the-best-point-and-click-website-builders" class="headerlink" title="What are the best point-and-click website builders?"></a>What are the best point-and-click website builders?</h2><p>A website builder is a type of software that lets you craft your business website, generally without programming knowledge or experience. Many allow you to choose from templates and then modify those templates to suit your look and layout.</p><p>Nearly all web hosting providers include some kind of website-building software. But for most hosting plans, it’s often an afterthought. By contrast, the website builders listed in this section are provided by web hosting services that have made point-and-click website building tools with excellent customer support and solid up-time a core priority in their offering. </p><p>You do sacrifice some control when choosing a website builder solution, but if you’ve never done any web development and you want a beautiful, usable website quickly, these services are for you. One warning: There are a lot of lock-ins here. You won’t be able to transfer the look of your site (and sometimes the content) to another hosting provider easily. So keep that in mind when you choose a website builder. </p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-a-web-host-and-a-web-server"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-a-web-host-and-a-web-server" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between a web host and a web server?"></a>What is the difference between a web host and a web server?</h2><p>A web host is a service provider, such as Wix or GoDaddy, that provides the space, storage, and resources required to keep a website online, typically under a rental agreement.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

These included France, the US, and the UK, as well as 400 respondents from four Asia-Pacific cities in Singapore, Australia, Japan, and Indonesia.</p><p>Interestingly, 41% saw 4- or 6-digit PIN codes as more secure than passwords. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/stop-using-your-4-digit-iphone-passcode-in-public-do-this-instead/"><strong>Stop using your 4-digit iPhone passcode in public. Do this instead</strong></a></p><p>The survey revealed that 51% reset their password at least once a month because they could not remember it, including 15% who did so weekly. </p><p>Across the four Asia-Pacific markets, 41% admitted to resetting their password at least once monthly while almost 10% did so weekly. Presented with a choice between biometrics or passwords, some 75% would opt for the former at least half the time, while a third would choose biometrics whenever available. </p><p>Globally, 58% would choose biometrics over passwords at least half the time and 33% would always do so, with 16% saying they would never select biometrics.</p><p>Amongst those who opted against doing so, a third described biometrics as more cumbersome than passwords, while 22% said their devices did not support this form of authentication. Some 17% pointed to security concerns over biometrics. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"><strong>How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)</strong></a></p><p>“There’s no one right way for organizations to authenticate customer, employee, or citizen identity,” said Entrust’s chief information security officer Mark Ruchie. “It’s always a tradeoff between providing relatively frictionless access experiences and incorporating safeguards that confirm users are who they claim to be. The authentication methods you employ can, and should, change depending on the circumstances, like the sensitivity of data users are accessing, whether you’re serving customers or employees, or if atypical login behaviors are exhibited.” </p><h2 id="Acceptance-over-loss-of-data-control"><a href="#Acceptance-over-loss-of-data-control" class="headerlink" title="Acceptance over loss of data control"></a>Acceptance over loss of data control</h2><p>The study also uncovered some interesting revelations about consumers’ attitudes towards ownership of their digital credentials and personal data. </p><p>Below half, at 45%, believed they <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apac-consumers-believe-onus-on-businesses-governments-to-safeguard-their-data/" >owned their personal information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some 28% said their data belonged to whoever controlled it, while 27% said ownership belonged to the issuer. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"><strong>The best VPN services (aren’t free)</strong></a></p><p>These sentiments might relate to how respondents felt about data control, with 74% noting that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apac-consumers-share-more-data-but-will-ditch-firms-over-security-breach/" >sharing their personal information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was unavoidable in order to access goods, services, and applications. </p><p>Asked if they felt comfortable entrusting their online identity with organizations they trusted to improve user experience, 54% said they would be. However, 46% felt otherwise, saying they should be the only one with ownership of their digital identity. </p><p>In Asia-Pacific, 75% also agreed that sharing their personal data in order to access products and services was unavoidable. Half would be comfortable with trusting organizations to own and store their digital identity, while the other half were not. </p><p>To help them feel more in control of their data, 42% across the globe pointed to the ability to revoke access, while 32% would want to know the organizations that had access to their personal information. Another 30% would want to know the organization’s privacy policy and 19% said mail should not contain personal data. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-security-key/"><strong>I tested the latest hardware security keys, and these are my must-haves</strong></a></p><p>Asked if they had a form of electronic identity, 43% said affirmatively while 36% said no. Some 21% were not sure if they had one, which Entrust said might suggest that not all respondents in the US, for instance, were aware their government had been automatically issuing digital passports to all holders since 2006. Just 27% in the country said they had an electronic identity. </p><p>Across the board, 70% would use a digital form of government-issued ID if available, with the majority citing convenience as the top benefit. However, while 49% said enhanced security was the reason they would use an electronic ID, 45% cited security concerns as the reason they would not do so. Another 36% pointed to identity theft as their concern for opting against a digital ID. </p><p>In Asia-Pacific, about 20% were unsure if they had an electronic ID, though, 70% would use a government-issued one if available. </p><p>Noting that both digital and physical identities had their challenges and benefits, Entrust COO Anudeep Parhar said: “It’s not a zero-sum game. Offering consumers access to both formats affords them the flexibility to choose what works best for them or for a given situation.”</p><h4 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink"

This means that you’d need a subscription to use LastPass on both your iPhone and your Windows PC, for example. So, while you can use LastPass for free on your iPhone and iPad, the free version won’t be also available for your Windows PC. This is why using iCloud Passwords for Windows is the best free option. </p><h4 id="Laptops"><a href="#Laptops" class="headerlink" title="Laptops"></a>Laptops</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-laptop/"  title="The top 5 cheap laptops: Affordable devices under $350">The top 5 cheap laptops: Affordable devices under $350 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-put-linux-on-a-microsoft-surface-go-in-just-an-hour/"  title="How I put Linux on a Microsoft Surface Go -- in just an hour">How I put Linux on a Microsoft Surface Go – in just an hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/"  title="The best laptops: Mac, PC, and Chromebook compared">The best laptops: Mac, PC, and Chromebook compared <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wiping-a-windows-laptop-heres-the-safest-free-way-to-erase-your-personal-data/"  title="Here&#39;s the safest way to permanently erase your laptop&#39;s drive">Here’s the safest way to permanently erase your laptop’s drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-laptop/"  title="The top 5 cheap laptops: Affordable devices under $350">The top 5 cheap laptops: Affordable devices under $350 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-put-linux-on-a-microsoft-surface-go-in-just-an-hour/"  title="How I put Linux on a Microsoft Surface Go -- in just an hour">How I put Linux on a Microsoft Surface Go – in just an hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/"  title="The best laptops: Mac, PC, and Chromebook compared">The best laptops: Mac, PC, and Chromebook compared <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wiping-a-windows-laptop-heres-the-safest-free-way-to-erase-your-personal-data/"  title="Here&#39;s the safest way to permanently erase your laptop&#39;s drive">Here’s the safest way to permanently erase your laptop’s drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-revamping-memories-editing-in-look-back-videos/"><u>[New] Revamping Memories Editing in Look Back Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://app-tips.techidaily.com/creating-effective-reminders-using-slackbot-a-step-by-step-guide-on-slack/"><u>Creating Effective Reminders Using Slackbot: A Step-by-Step Guide on Slack</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-realme-narzo-60x-5g-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Realme Narzo 60x 5G to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://app-tips.techidaily.com/how-vital-are-it-specialists-for-modern-businesses-operating-without-technology-insights-from-a-zdnet-perspective/"><u>How Vital Are IT Specialists for Modern Businesses Operating Without Technology?

Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows.

The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11.

But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139122/17108" target="_top" id="2139122">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139122" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139122/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It can generate and save unique and complex passwords (or passphrases) for each of your website account logins. Securely storing the password along with your username, the site’s URL, and other info, the program applies your credentials at each website, automatically logging you in.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>But Proton boasts that its password manager kicks in end-to-end encryption across the board. Some password managers encrypt only the password for each saved account and not necessarily the username, URL, or other information. This pitfall means that a hacker or attacker who gains access to your account data can easily see the sites you visit and the usernames you create.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-are-the-most-hacked-passwords-is-yours-on-the-list/"><strong>These are the most hacked passwords. Is yours on the list?</strong></a></p><p>To better safeguard your accounts against compromise, Proton Pass promises to encrypt every field in each saved login, not just the password but your username, the website URL, and any other data. To protect all your login data, Proton says that its open-source password manager uses a strong <a class="link"   href="https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-in-action-understanding-bcrypt/" >bcrypt password hashing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technique and a hardened implementation of <a class="link"   href="https://proton.me/blog/encrypted-email-authentication" >Secure Remote Password (SRP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to authenticate access.</p><p>Further, <a class="link"   href="https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?product=pass&language=en" >Proton Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> syncs your account data across all your devices and runs automatic end-to-end encrypted backups of your data. So if you lose or upgrade from one device, you can still access your saved logins from the online backups to use on a different device. Plus, Proton adds <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/better-than-the-best-password-how-to-use-2fa-to-improve-your-security/" >two-factor authentication <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so that accessing your account on a new device or in a new location requires a second form of verification.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/flipper-zero-hacking-tool-is-a-big-hit/"><strong>Flipper Zero hacking tool is a big hit</strong></a></p><p>Proton Pass also aims to protect your email address by letting you create an alias. If someone tries to use one of your passwords for identity theft or another type of attack, you can always change it. But if that person attempts to use your email address as part of the identity theft scheme, you can’t easily change that. Your email address can also be used for sending you spam and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-phishing-how-to-protect-yourself-from-scam-emails-and-more/" >phishing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> messages.</p><p>To help you better protect your identity, the Proton Pass hide-my-email alias feature will create a random address that links between your actual address and the website. The site sees just your alias address so that your real address is kept private. If a particular site is hacked, only your alias address is exposed, which you can easily change.</p><p>Proton</p><p>And what’s the <a class="link"   href="https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?product=pass&language=en" >price tag for Proton Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? In a bid to get people to sign up, Proton is offering the basic version for free. This free flavor offers unlimited logins, unlimited encrypted notes, and a limited number of hide-my-email aliases and two-factor authentication logins.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/do-rfid-blocking-cards-actually-work-my-flipper-zero-revealed-the-truth/"><strong>Do RFID blocking cards actually work? My Flipper Zero revealed the truth</strong></a></p><p>To grab an unlimited number of hide-my-email aliases and two-factor authentication logins, you’ll need a paid account called <a class="link"   href="https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?product=pass&language=en" >Proton Pass Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. People with Proton Unlimited, Business, Visionary, or Family plans automatically get the paid edition of Proton Pass for free. For others, Proton is currently offering the Plus version for <a class="link"   href="https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?product=pass&language=en" >$1 a month for lifetime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But this offer lasts only until the end of July, after which the price goes up to $3.99 a month.</p><p>Proton Pass supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, and other browsers as well as iPhones, iPads, and Android devices.

However, this fever has yet to break among technology professionals, with new research revealing a quarter of IT professionals are considering quitting their jobs in the next six months. Heavy workloads, stress, and isolation associated with remote work are to blame.</p><p>“This exodus of IT workers has the potential to cost US employers more than $145 billion,” Ivanti’s report, based on a <a class="link"   href="https://www.ivanti.com/resources/v/doc/ivi/2765/df9a470841ea" >survey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of 8,400 executives, professionals, and office workers, states. It adds that IT professionals are also 1.4 times more likely to “quiet quit” than other knowledge workers. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/40-of-workers-will-have-to-reskill-in-the-next-three-years-due-to-ai-says-ibm-study/" >40% of workers will have to reskill in the next three years due to AI, says IBM study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>There is also this disturbing finding: Among the quarter of IT professionals considering quitting their jobs, 31% report their mental health is suffering. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The report’s authors also estimate that there has been a 73% increase in IT workloads due to hybrid or remote working, and at least one in four professionals is suffering from burnout. IT professionals are also 2.5 times more likely to work longer hours when working remotely. In addition, 23% of IT workers cite loss of connection to colleagues while just 17% of office workers cite this loss. </p><p>Still, despite these challenges, the vast majority of IT professionals (84%) want to continue to work remotely at least some of the time. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ai-generated-crypto-invoice-scam-almost-got-me-and-im-a-security-pro/" >This AI-generated crypto invoice scam almost got me, and I’m a security pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>What does it take to assure a more positive work environment for many stressed-out technology workers and professionals? For their part, the report’s authors point to a “lack of resources, tools, and support,” versus a direct result of remote work, which many actually find beneficial. </p><p>Industry leaders across the spectrum share their concerns and advice about working with information technology: </p><h2 id="Keep-learning"><a href="#Keep-learning" class="headerlink" title="Keep learning"></a><strong>Keep learning</strong></h2><p>“Keep learning is my best advice,” says <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdun/?originalSubdomain=uk" >Andrew Duncan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, CEO and managing partner at Infosys Consulting. “New experiences, new skills development, and new project opportunities are always the best path to keep advancing. Find a mentor that can help you through coaching and advisory – these types of more seasoned business veterans are often a great ticket to opening new doors within a company, especially for younger professionals. Keep yourself visible and market yourself – show people your successes and achievements and the value you have created in a project.” </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Be-a-team-player"><a href="#Be-a-team-player" class="headerlink" title="Be a team player"></a><strong>Be a team player</strong></h2><p>“Become critically important for the success of your team,” says <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zavn/" >Zaven Nahapetyan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, co-founder of Niche.club, and a former engineering manager at Facebook. “As you get more senior, think about your team in broader terms: First, your immediate coworkers, then your organization.

Managers should know the top two or three goals of each of their employees, particularly those goals which may cross over from the professional world into the personal. The sooner a manager realizes that they cannot succeed by managing every employee identically, the stronger that manager’s retention metric will be, whether in cybersecurity or any other industry.” </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Shift-thinking-from-heads-down-tech-to-heads-up-business-concerns"><a href="#Shift-thinking-from-heads-down-tech-to-heads-up-business-concerns" class="headerlink" title="Shift thinking from heads-down tech to heads-up business concerns"></a><strong>Shift thinking from heads-down tech to heads-up business concerns</strong></h2><p>“A tech professional who demonstrates how costs could be offset through IT activities instead of simply outlining costs of a project is more likely to be hired or retained,” says <a class="link"   href="https://www.paychex.com/newsroom/executive-bios/jeff-williams" >Jeff Williams <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, VP of enterprise and HRO service for Paychex. “Develop the ability to clearly communicate and speak the language of business leaders and investors to position yourself as a business driver and an indispensable asset. Be a student of your firm. Know the income statement, the balance sheet, your competition, and your operating environment. Go to places that differentiate you, your knowledge, and your upside. To build a bridge to more senior positions, you must demonstrate an understanding of the business you’re in and the role technology plays.

Organizations can also boost their competitiveness if they are given support to digitalize, decarbonize, and globalize.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/3-ways-to-find-a-great-ai-partner-for-your-enterprise/" >3 ways to secure the best AI partner for your business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> </p><p>These measures will be integral to helping enterprises, particularly small businesses, deal with rising costs and a challenging business environment in a softening global economy.</p><p>Research suggests just 25% of companies in Singapore are confident the economy will improve during the next 12 months, compared to 41% the year before, according to <a class="link"   href="https://www.sbf.org.sg/newsroom/media/press-releases/detail/singapore-business-sentiment-weakens-amidst-economic-uncertainties-tightening-credit-cost-increases-and-manpower-challenges" >SBF’s latest national business survey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Some 58% of companies cite increased business costs as the top challenge, with 75% pointing to manpower costs as the key contributor. The survey respondents would like more support from the government for their ESG initiatives, as well as adoption of AI tools and global expansion. </p><p>The SBF survey, which polled 1,056 companies, also anticipates 2024 being a more challenging year for local businesses that will face headwinds in domestic and international markets. </p><p>“We recommend the government takes the lead to streamline procurement practices with smaller enterprises that may rely heavily on government projects,” KPMG and SBF said in a joint statement. </p><p>“To tackle manpower constraints, Singapore must maintain its openness to overseas talent and strengthen policies that promote the development of local talent. A public-private review of business competitiveness is needed to identify opportunities for cost mitigation even as we press ahead with industry transformation.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-divergent-skills-that-matter-in-an-ai-world-math-and-business-development/"><strong>Two divergent skills that matter in an AI world: Math and business development</strong></a></p><p>The report authors call for a tiered support model to facilitate companies in their digitalization roadmaps, spanning from a lower-tier grant support covering 20% of backoffice and operational digitalization initiatives, to a top-tier grant of 60% in funding support for the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-looks-for-generative-ai-use-cases-with-sandbox-options/" >adoption of artificial intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (AI) and digital ledger technologies. </p><p>The report also suggests the government should reassess existing grants and subsidies, such as the Enterprise Innovation Scheme or Productivity Solutions Grant, and allow smaller companies to pay only the net cost of digital solutions to help them with their cash flow. Services providers can then claim the rest of the subsidies directly from the government. </p><p>Grant programs, the report suggests, should be expanded to include digital projects where development work is led out of Singapore, but involve resources from the region. The Enterprise Development Grant, for example, currently stipulates that such development work must be fulfilled locally. This restriction could stifle progress as businesses might not be able to access resources and skillsets to drive the work in a timely manner.</p><p>In addition, a universal grant program that covers the cost of AI and machine learning adoption and employee upskilling will be helpful for businesses looking to build training datasets and carry out data analysis and testing. </p><p>Smaller companies will also appreciate support in upskilling and retraining employees in emerging technologies, including AI, to acquire the necessary capabilities to handle <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-identifies-six-generative-ai-risks-sets-up-foundation-to-guide-adoption/" >new cyber threats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-operating-model-to-compete-in-ai-economy/"><strong>Businesses need a new operating model to compete in an AI-powered economy</strong></a></p><p>Organizations would further benefit from reskilling that can support their ESG development journey, which the government can provide through enhanced tax deductions for accredited training programs and tax subsidies. </p><p>The Singapore government can collaborate with sectoral agencies and trade associations to establish decarbonization industry roadmaps, with the aim of facilitating organizations’ transition to a greener ecosystem. </p><p>For instance, the report recommends that the Enterprise Financing Scheme - Green initiative is expanded to boost lending by eligible financial institutions and help smaller companies begin <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/singapore-firms-struggle-to-align-sustainability-goals-with-business-objectives/" >their sustainability journeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The report also calls for the establishment of data-sharing platforms to facilitate the exchange of ESG data, such as greenhouse gas emissions associated with certain activities. This process will enable businesses to carry out checks on internal data or make estimates when information is not available. </p><p>Furthermore, Singapore could look to calibrate its property tax policies to offer lower rates for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-wants-only-data-centres-that-are-efficient/" >green commercial and industrial buildings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which would motivate building owners to meet greener building requirements. </p><h4 id="Artificial-Intelligence"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence"></a>Artificial Intelligence</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-photoshops-new-text-to-image-as-good-as-midjourney-and-dall-e-we-test-it-and-see/"  title="Photoshop vs. Midjourney vs. DALL-E 3: Only one AI image generator passed my 5 tests">Photoshop vs. Midjourney vs. DALL-E 3: Only one AI image generator passed my 5 tests <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-powered-narrative-attacks-a-growing-threat-3-defense-strategies-for-business-leaders/"  title="AI-powered &#39;narrative attacks&#39; a growing threat: 3 defense strategies for business leaders">AI-powered ‘narrative attacks’ a growing threat: 3 defense strategies for business leaders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/copilot-pro-vs-chatgpt-plus-which-is-ai-chatbot-is-worth-your-20-a-month/"  title="Copilot Pro vs. ChatGPT Plus: Which AI chatbot is worth your $20 a month?">Copilot Pro vs. ChatGPT Plus: Which AI chatbot is worth your $20 a month?

Big data, analytics, and data engineering are the most in-demand technology skills, with around half (51%) of CIOs looking to increase their internal headcount for data capabilities during the next 12 months.</p><p>With an organization’s board keen to discover how emerging technologies – such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things – can help the business to gain a competitive advantage, the demand for high-quality data talent is only going to increase.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>It’s with this battle for talent in mind that Andy Moore, chief data officer (CDO) at Bentley Motors, is leading an initiative to help the automotive giant attract, train, and retain data-literate professionals.</p><p>Moore explained to ZDNET at <a class="link"   href="https://www.snowflake.com/events/data-cloud-world-tour-london/" >the London leg of Snowflake’s Data Cloud World Tour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> how the apprenticeship program is a “digital pipeline of future talent.”</p><p>This pipeline takes people from school and into Bentley as degree apprentices. The young professionals spend 20% of their week in education and 80% at Bentley learning hands-on data skills across a range of areas from data analysis to software development and user interface design.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/math-and-business-development-why-the-2-divergents-skills-matter-in-an-ai-world/" >Math and business development: Why the 2 divergents skills matter in an AI world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Moore says the apprenticeship program, now in its fifth year, is “laser-focused” on data science. </p><p>“I’ve had about 30 people go through the apprenticeship, and the first people have now graduated and gone into permanent roles, which is great,” he says.</p><p>The key message, says Moore, is that Bentley’s apprenticeship program is adding data talent to the IT skills pool and it’s helping to foster a community of like-minded professionals.</p><p>“We’ve got a group of people who’ve gone through the program. It’s not just one school leaver going to a corner of an office and not being sure how to fit in,” he says. “I’ve now got people on first, second, third, and fourth years of degrees. That depth of talent means there’s always someone to ask for help and support. There’s a great community.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/education/business-management/5-ways-to-step-up-and-become-a-manager/" >5 ways to step up and become a manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Moore says Bentley recruits the students and then places them with a university. </p><p>“I’m keen first and foremost that they’re coming to Bentley and they’re adding value. They’re connecting with the brand, sustainability, and inclusivity that we offer – and a lot of people are resonating with that idea.” </p><p>When it comes to recruiting talent for the program, Moore says he’s put a lot of effort into going to schools. </p><p>He typically looks for a solid grade in math, as both the degree and the work at Bentley are “stats-heavy”.</p><p>Bentley is using the UK government’s apprenticeship levy to help fund the program, which not only covers the cost of the student’s undergraduate degree but also provides a wage during their time with the company, says Moore.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/5-ways-to-boost-your-skills-and-increase-your-career-opportunities/" >5 ways to boost your skills and increase your career opportunities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“The starting salary is just over £20,000, but it increases considerably over the four years that they’re working with us.”</p><p>While other companies are also looking to develop next-generation professionals through degree apprenticeship programs, Moore says Bentley’s approach is pioneering, particularly given its focus on hard-to-find data skills.</p><p>“I think we are fairly early to grasp the degree apprenticeship opportunity and do it at scale,” he says. “While some people won’t necessarily want to stay with Bentley at the end of their degree, they’ll still have a great journey over the four years, and they’ll contribute to the business.”</p><p>Bev White, chief executive at Nash Squared, agrees that on-the-job training programs like the one that Bentley is pioneering are a great way for companies to find fresh talent and for young people to become exposed to new skills.</p><p>“Apprenticeships bang the door wide open for lots of people,” she says. “I think they’re a fantastic way of helping young people understand what a job looks like, what working in an organization feels like, and what managers will expect from you.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/business-leaders-focus-on-data-literacy/" >Business leaders continue to struggle with harnessing the power of data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Back at Bentley, Moore says it’s important to recognize that apprenticeships are just one crucial element of a much broader approach to data capability within the business.</p><p>He’s also increased internal experience through external hires: “The aim is to build that data science competence centrally, and also enable the rest of the business.”</p><p>More generally, he’s created an enterprise-wide data strategy at Bentley, which is built around four core pillars: governance; the data cloud, which is the technology stack that’s required to use data effectively; the data dojo, which is his internal data literacy program; and enablement, which focuses on helping the data team to work with the rest of the business.</p><p>Moore pays specific attention to the data literacy program, which takes professionals in the business from white to black belt. </p><p>“Even with white belts, it’s about getting people to ask basic questions, such as, ‘Why is it important to have common terminology and to have some restricted fields?’” says Moore.</p><p>The aim is to ensure everyone in Bentley has a strong awareness of how data should be used, why it needs to be governed, and how you can use those information assets effectively.</p><p>“I’ve worked with different areas of the business to bring out data challenges, whether it’s a visualization challenge or in data science as we get more mature,” he says. “Let’s say it’s quality – what can we do with quality data? How do we join together factory-quality and field-quality indicators and use that information to drive business decisions?”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-real-time-revolution-is-here-but-its-unevenly-distributed/" >The real-time revolution is here, but it’s unevenly distributed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From the people joining Bentley as apprentices all the way up to senior managers, Moore’s aim is to help people across the company make the most of data – and that exposure could lead to some of those individuals rising to the upper echelons of the business one day.</p><p>“One thing I was very keen on when building the data strategy is that there’s career progression,” he says. </p><p>“The degree apprentices can see they can go into a mid-level, early career role, and then they can go on to a senior role as well. And, obviously, the pyramid ends ultimately with my role as CDO.”</p><h4 id="Big-Data"><a href="#Big-Data" class="headerlink" title="Big Data"></a>Big Data</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/were-you-caught-up-in-the-latest-data-breach-heres-how-to-tell/"  title="How to find out if you are involved in a data breach (and what to do next)">How to find out if you are involved in a data breach (and what to do next) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fighting-bias-in-ai-starts-with-the-data/"  title="Fighting bias in AI starts with the data">Fighting bias in AI starts with the data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fair-forecast-how-180-meteorologists-are-delivering-good-enough-weather-data/"  title="Fair forecast?

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576477/17382" target="_top" id="1576477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576477/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997662/19272" target="_top" id="1997662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997662/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Shamim, David Weisz, Goutham Seshadri, Kevin Kim, Shengqi Hang, and Erez Lieberman Aiden, used a technique called “address linking” to study the Bitcoin transactions in the first two years of its existence: January of 2009 to February of 2011. </p><p>Their key discovery is that, in those first two years, “most Bitcoin was mined by only sixty-four agents […] collectively accounting for ₿2,676,800 (PV: $84 billion).” They are referring to the process of minting new coins by solving computer challenges. </p><p>That number – 64 people in total – “is 1000-fold smaller than prior estimates of the size of the early Bitcoin community (75,000),” they observe. </p><p>Those 64 people include some notable figures that have already become legends, such as Ross Ulbricht, known by the handle Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht is the founder of Silk Road, a black-market operation that used Bitcoin for illicit means – until it was shut down by the FBI. </p><p>“Fig 1. Sixty-four agents mined most of the bitcoin between bitcoin’s launch and when it achieved price parity with the US dollar. We exploited data leakage to construct a map of the blockchain in early 2011, in which bitcoin are arranged according to the agent that mined them.”</p><p>Blackburn et al.</p><p>For Blackburn and team, the point was to study the effects of people participating in game-theoretic situations as anonymous parties. Surprisingly, they found early insiders like Ulbricht could have exploited the relative paucity of participants by undermining Bitcoin to double-spend coins, but they did not. They acted “altruistically” to maintain the integrity of the system.</p><p>That’s intriguing, but a more pressing discovery is that addresses can be traced and identities can be revealed. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997657/19272" target="_top" id="1997657">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997657" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997657/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends-1"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-1" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-crypto-wallet/" >The best crypto hardware wallets If you’re serious about keeping your cryptocurrency secure, then you need a bitcoin hardware wallet.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>To find out who was doing those early transactions, Blackburn and team had to reverse-engineer the entire premise of Bitcoin and of all crypto: anonymity. </p><p>As outlined in <a class="link"   href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" >the original Bitcoin white paper <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Satoshi Nakamoto, privacy was to be preserved by two means: anonymous public key use and creating new key pairs for every transaction:</p><blockquote><p><em>The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the “tape”, is made public, but without telling who the parties were.</em> </p><p><em>As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.</em> </p></blockquote><p>Blackburn and team had to trace those key pairs to reveal early Bitcoin’s transacting parties. To do so, they developed what they called a novel address-linking scheme. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="More-Crypto-Coach"><a href="#More-Crypto-Coach" class="headerlink" title="More Crypto Coach"></a>More Crypto Coach</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-do-i-buy-bitcoin-the-crypto-coach-shows-you-how/" >How do I buy Bitcoin?

In fact, there are extensive correlations between the apparently-meaningless strings associated with a single user. The other two techniques exploit insecure user behaviors, such as the use of multiple addresses to pay for a single transaction, that make it possible to link addresses based on transaction activity.</em> </p></blockquote><p>The consequence of that, they write, is that it is possible to “follow the money” to expose any identity by following a chain of relatedness in a graph of addresses, starting from a known identity:</p><blockquote><p><em>These network properties have unintended privacy consequences, because they make the network much more vulnerable to deanonymization using a “follow-the-money” approach. In this approach, the identity of a target bitcoin address can be ascertained by identifying a short transaction path linking it to an address whose identity is known, and then using off-chain data sources (ranging from public data to subpoenas) to walk along the path, determining who-paid-whom to de-identify addresses until the target address is identified.</em></p></blockquote><p>Further, they hypothesize that “many cryptocurrencies may be susceptible to follow-the-money attacks.”</p><p>Blackburn told <em>The New York Times</em>‘s Siobhan Roberts, “When you are encrypting private data and making it public, you cannot assume that it’ll be private forever.” </p><p>As the team concludes in the report, “Drip-by-drip, information leakage erodes the once-impenetrable blocks, carving out a new landscape of socioeconomic data.” </p><h4 id="More-Crypto"><a href="#More-Crypto" class="headerlink" title="More Crypto"></a>More Crypto</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-do-i-buy-bitcoin-the-crypto-coach-shows-you-how/"  title="How do I buy Bitcoin?

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137223/26400" target="_top" id="2137223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137223/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

LastPass has grown significantly in recent years, with more than 50% revenue CAGR over the last three years. </p><p>LogMeIn CEO Bill Wagner <a class="link"   href="https://www.logmein.com/newsroom/press-release/2021/logmein-set-to-establish-lastpass-as-an-independent-cloud-security-company-amid-strong-market-demand" >said <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the scale, growth, and market position of LastPass make it “a perfect candidate to seize new opportunities as its own standalone company.” </p><p>“Today’s announcement also reflects our strategic priority to strengthen and invest in our flexible work enablement portfolio across unified communications and collaboration and IT management and support,” Wagner added. </p><p>LogMeIn owns several other products, including GoToConnect, GoToMeeting and Rescue. </p><p>Investor Andrew Kowal, a partner at Francisco Partners, noted that LogMeIn saw an opportunity to “unlock the full potential” of LastPass and improve the service’s offerings to customers. </p><p>In a message to users, LastPass reiterated that it could “strategically increase investment and support” in its mission as an independent company. </p><p>“You will start to see an enhanced LastPass, on an accelerated timeline. We are working on faster, seamless save and fill, a delightful mobile experience, and even more third-party integrations for businesses, among many other updates,” LastPass told users. </p><p>“This is the same great product, now with even more focus on keeping your data safe.”</p><h4 id="Tech-Earnings"><a href="#Tech-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Tech Earnings"></a>Tech Earnings</h4><p><a
