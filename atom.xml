Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037474/7443" target="_top" id="2037474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037474/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052059/7443" target="_top" id="2052059">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052059" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052059/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

In a blog post, 1Password product director Mitch Cohen announced the <a class="link"   href="https://blog.1password.com/unlock-1password-individual-passkey-beta/" >expansion of the passkey beta program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from private to public. This means that anyone creating a new individual account can secure it with a passkey instead of a master password or secret key.</p><p>However, Cohen noted, “the ability to unlock 1Password with a passkey is currently for new accounts only. Next year, we’ll make this feature available to anyone with an existing 1Password account.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" >The best password managers to save you from login hassle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Password managers have long been considered a convenient and secure way to protect all of your website accounts. However, securing your access typically requires a master password or secret key. Make that password too long and complex, and it’s a hassle to remember and use it. Make it too simple, and you’re inviting hackers to figure it out.</p><p>The passkey method, now <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/dashlane-launches-passwordless-login-for-new-users-only-so-far/" >gaining traction among more companies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, offers a safer and easier way to safeguard your account and all your login credentials.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In his post, Cohen explained how passkeys work in general and with 1Password. Passkeys take advantage of a security technology called <a class="link"   href="https://blog.1password.com/what-is-public-key-cryptography/" >public-key cryptography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. As such, every passkey contains two aspects: a private key and a public key.</p><p>When setting up a 1Password account with a passkey, the private key is kept secure and encrypted and never shared with 1Password itself. The public key is stored on the company’s servers and is used to authenticate your login attempts. But that public key is of no use without the corresponding private key. So even if the bad guys hacked into 1Password’s servers and somehow gained access to the key, they wouldn’t be able to sign into your account.</p><p>The ability to unlock 1Password with a passkey is currently for new accounts only. Next year, we’ll make this feature available to anyone with an existing 1Password account. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/dashlane-launches-passwordless-login-for-new-users-only-so-far/" >Dashlane launches passwordless login - for new users only so far <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To set up a 1Password account with a passkey, download and install the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id1511601750" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepassword.android&hl=en" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. Open the app and browse to the <a class="link"   href="https://1password.com/sign-up/passkey-preview" >sign-up page for the public beta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Start setting up your account. At some point, you’ll be prompted to create your passkey.</p><p>When asked to enter an email address, pick one that isn’t already connected to a 1Password account. You should then be prompted to create your passkey, which you can save to iCloud Keychain on an iPhone and Google Password Manager on an Android device. </p><p>To access 1Password on a different device, open the app or head to the <a class="link"   href="https://my.1password.com/signin?a=new" >sign-in page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Follow the steps to <a class="link"   href="https://support.1password.com/add-account/#add-another-account-to-the-1password-apps" >add another account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose the option to sign in with passkey. Enter your email address and again select the option to Sign in with passkey. You may need to use a QR code on your device or authenticate it with a passcode or facial or fingerprint recognition. You’ll receive a verification code that you then enter on your other device.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/passkeys-what-are-they-and-how-to-get-started/" >What are passkeys? Experience the life-changing magic of going passwordless <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The steps for creating an account with a passkey and using that passkey on a different device are also described on 1Password’s website in “<a class="link"   href="https://support.1password.com/passkeys/" >Unlock 1Password with a passkey (beta) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.” And any 1Password account you create through the new public beta will give you an extended free trial good until the beta ends.</p><h4

Read now</a></p><p>The emails – part of an attack that Proofpoint researchers said began in October but increased in November – generally contain information about COVID-19 testing and the new Omicron variant.</p><p>Cybercriminals and threat actors <a class="link"   href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/cybercriminals-unleash-diverse-wave-of-attacks-on-covid-19-vaccine-researchers/" >have used concern about COVID-19 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as a phishing lure since the pandemic began to cause headlines in January and February of 2020. </p><p>But with this specific attack, cybercriminals are spoofing the login portals of schools like Vanderbilt University, the University of Central Missouri and more. Some mimic generic Office 365 login portals, while others use legitimate-looking university pages.</p><p>“It is likely this activity will increase in the next two months as colleges and universities provide and require testing for students, faculty, and other workers traveling to and from campus during and after the holiday season, and as the Omicron variant emerges more widely,” the Proofpoint researchers wrote. </p><p>“We expect more threat actors will adopt COVID-19 themes given the introduction of the Omicron variant. This assessment is based on previously published research that identified COVID-19 themes making a resurgence in email campaigns following the emergence of the Delta variant in August 2021.”</p><p>In some cases, Proofpoint found that the emails redirected potential victims to the actual websites of their university after their credentials are stolen. The emails typically come with subject lines like “Attention Required - Information Regarding COVID-19 Omicron Variant - November 29.” Others are tagged with “COVID test.”</p><p>A screenshot of one of the spoofed pages.</p><p>Proofpoint</p><p>Thousands of messages have been sent using Omicron as a lure, and the emails typically have malicious files attached or come with URLs that steal credentials for university accounts. </p><p>In some cases, Proofpoint found that attacks using attachments “leveraged legitimate but compromised WordPress websites to host credential capture webpages.”</p><p>“In some campaigns, threat actors attempted to steal multifactor authentication (MFA) credentials, spoofing MFA providers such as Duo. Stealing MFA tokens enables the attacker to bypass the second layer of security designed to keep out threat actors who already know a victim’s username and password,” the researchers explained. </p><p>“While many messages are sent via spoofed senders, Proofpoint has observed threat actors leveraging legitimate, compromised university accounts to send COVID-19 themed threats. It is likely the threat actors are stealing credentials from universities and using compromised mailboxes to send the same threats to other universities. Proofpoint does not attribute this activity to a known actor or threat group, and the ultimate objective of the threat actors is currently unknown.”</p><p>Hank Schless, a senior manager at Lookout, told <em>ZDNet</em> that at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was a ton of malicious phishing activity centered around the virus that tempted people with promises of increased government aid, information about shutdowns, and even self-testing apps. </p><p>From Q4 2019 into Q1 2020, Schless said his company saw an 87% increase in enterprise mobile phishing. </p><p>By early 2021, Schless noted that attackers changed their tune to deliver the same attacks with the promise of information around vaccines and reopenings. </p><p>“Between Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, exposure to phishing increased 127% and remained at the same level through Q2 and Q3. Now, with questions around the Delta and Omicron variants, attackers are again using this as a way to convince potential victims to trust their communication and unknowingly share login credentials or download malware. Academic institutions make for ripe targets in the eyes of cybercriminals,” Schless said. </p><p>“Large institutions may be conducting cutting-edge research or have massive endowments – both types of data than an attacker would want to steal or encrypt for a ransomware attack. Phishing campaigns know no industry, organization, or device type. They’re designed to be agile attacks that can be tweaked to target any individual.” </p><p>He explained that while the attackers’ end goal discovered by Proofpoint is still unknown, a set of legitimate login credentials can be the most valuable asset to an attacker trying to infiltrate an organization’s infrastructure. </p><p>By entering under the guise of a legitimate user, the attacker has a greater chance of accessing sensitive data without tripping any alarms, Schless added, noting that these campaigns are often the starting point for more advanced cyber attacks.</p><h4 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-8-concealed-video-downloading-software-of-2023/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best 8 Concealed Video Downloading Software of 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-vr-journey-best-pc-360-video-streamers-reviewed/"><u>[New] The Ultimate VR Journey Best PC 360 Video Streamers Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-image-transitions-with-ease-and-style/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Image Transitions with Ease and Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/windows-mac-androidios/"><u>安定電腦、平板或智能手機上的視頻 -

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130874/7443" target="_top" id="2130874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134236/18498" target="_top" id="2134236">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134236" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134236/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

A <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" >password manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can help you organize and store this information securely while giving you quick access when you need it. You don’t even need to pay a premium for this service, as there are several great free password managers to choose from. </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-free-password-manager-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-free-password-manager-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best free password manager right now?"></a>What is the best free password manager right now?</h2><p>At ZDNET, we’ve tested a wide range of free password managers to find those you can trust to keep your passwords secure from threats and accessible when you need them. Our pick for the best free password manager is <a class="link"   href="https://bitwarden.com/" >Bitwarden <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which allows you to sync as many logins as you want across all your devices while protecting your data with strong encryption and several layers of security. </p><p>These are the best free password managers to securely store your data in 2024. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"><strong>The best antivirus software</strong></a></p><h2 id="The-best-free-password-managers-of-2024"><a href="#The-best-free-password-managers-of-2024" class="headerlink" title="The best free password managers of 2024"></a>The best free password managers of 2024</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://bitwarden.com/" >Bitwarden Best free password manager overall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Bitwarden&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Syncs unlimited passwords on unlimited devices</li><li>Open source</li><li>Passkey support</li><li>Data breach reporting</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Premium features such as emergency access require paid plan</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p>Bitwarden offers everything you need in a basic password manager – plus some premium features – at no cost, which makes it our top pick for free password management (and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-bitwarden-features-that-make-it-my-favorite-password-manager/" >one of our favorite password managers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, period). </p><p>Users on Bitwarden’s free tier can create and store an unlimited number of logins that sync across an unlimited number of devices with access wherever you need them: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android as well as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Vivaldi, Edge, Brave, Opera, Tor, and DuckDuckGo (currently in beta on macOS). The free plan also includes useful tools like encrypted text sharing via Bitwarden Send, the ability to share vault items with another user, and a handful of multi-factor authentication (MFA) options for accessing your vault. </p><p>Bitwarden is open source, meaning its code is available for anyone to identify security flaws that need to be patched, and the platform undergoes regular security audits and testing. It also supports passkeys both for saved logins and access to your Bitwarden vault, adding a layer of security beyond even a complex password and two-factor authentication. The free tier also includes basic vault health reporting, so you’ll be alerted if any of your saved usernames were exposed in a data breach. </p><p>Bitwarden has a no-frills interface, and some of its features – like autofill and its built-in password generator – are clunkier than other platforms. But as a completely free password manager, it’s a solid choice for most people. </p><p><strong>Bitwarden features:</strong> Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure vault sharing between two users | Secure note storage | Password generator | Encrypted text sharing via Bitwarden Send | Passkey support | Biometric unlock | Multi-factor authentication for vault | Username data breach reports</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://bitwarden.com/" >View now at Bitwarden <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://nordpass.com/" >NordPass Best free password manager for new users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Nord&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Unlimited password storage</li><li>Clean, consistent user interface</li><li>Passkey support</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Can only be logged in on one device at a time</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p>NordPass is the password manager from Nord Security, the cybersecurity company behind <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nordvpn-review/" >NordVPN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and secure cloud storage service NordLocker. Its free tier offers the essentials of password management: unlimited password storage with autosave and autofill, a built-in password generator, and passkey support, all in a user-friendly interface that’s consistent across platforms. </p><p>NordPass’s most significant limitation is that you can only be logged into your vault on one device at a time – accessing your account via mobile app will log you out on desktop, and vice versa. This is more of a minor inconvenience for most users, as it simply requires logging back into your vault using your master password, biometrics, or one-time code when you switch devices. NordPass is multi-platform, with apps for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux and extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge. </p><p>While signing up for NordPass does require you to create a universal Nord Account login in addition to a master password for your vault, you can access all of Nord Security’s tools under the same credentials. Like other trusted password managers, NordPass uses strong encryption and has undergone an independent security audit. You can also enable multi-factor authentication as an extra measure to protect your vault. </p><p>NordPass’s intuitive platform on its free tier is a good choice for users new to password management who don’t mind having to log in with each device switch. Note, though, that if you want any extra features like security monitoring, file storage, or emergency access, you’ll need to upgrade to a paid account, which starts at $1.39 per month for a single user. </p><p><strong>NordPass features:</strong> Unlimited passwords on one device at a time | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure note storage | Username and password generator | Passkey support | Biometric unlock | Multi-factor authentication for vault | 24&#x2F;7 customer support</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://nordpass.com/" >View now at Nord Security <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://go.getproton.me/aff%5Fc?offer_id=26&aff_id=4706&source=ZDNET&aff_sub=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp&url=https://proton.me/pass/?visitorId=ho-%7Btransaction_id%7D&aid=%7Baffiliate_id%7D&offer_id=%7Boffer_id%7D&url_id=%7Boffer_url_id%7D&utm_campaign=ww-all-2c-vpn-gro_aff-g_acq-partners_program&utm_source=aid-tune-%7Baffiliate_id%7D&utm_medium=link&utm_term=vpn_home_plans_offer_hfp_landing&utm_content=%7Boffer_id%7D&hfp=true&phfp=true&spl=%7Baffiliate_id%7D&aap=%7Baffiliate_id%7D" >Proton Pass Best free password manager for privacy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Proton Pass&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices</li><li>10 hide-my-email aliases included</li><li>Basic security monitoring with Pass Monitor</li><li>Open source</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Integrated 2FA limited to three logins</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p>Proton Pass is an open-source password manager that combines highly secure storage with premium features for all users, including those on its free tier. With a free account, you get unlimited password storage accessible on an unlimited number of devices and across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, and Edge. Proton Pass has a user-friendly design and a simple, guided setup process, making it a solid alternative to NordPass for those new to password management. </p><p>A free Proton Pass account includes several features usually found only on paid plans. You get up to 10 hide-my-email aliases, which can minimize tracking and spam tied to your personal address, and vault health reports as part of Pass Monitor. Proton Pass does offer integrated two-factor authentication support, but this is limited to three accounts unless you upgrade to a premium tier. </p><p>As the password management solution from Proton, the Swiss privacy company known for its VPN and encrypted email services, Proton Pass meets high security standards. Like Bitwarden, its code is available for independent review, and the platform undergoes audits that are made available to the public. </p><p>If you are looking for a well-designed and highly secure password manager with a handful of unique features, Proton Pass is worthy of consideration. </p><p><strong>Proton Pass features:</strong> Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure password sharing | Integrated two-factor authentication (up to 3 logins) | Hide-my-email aliases (up to 10) | Password generator | Password health reports | Passkey support | Biometric unlock on mobile</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://go.getproton.me/aff%5Fc?offer_id=26&aff_id=4706&source=ZDNET&aff_sub=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp&url=https://proton.me/pass/?visitorId=ho-%7Btransaction_id%7D&aid=%7Baffiliate_id%7D&offer_id=%7Boffer_id%7D&url_id=%7Boffer_url_id%7D&utm_campaign=ww-all-2c-vpn-gro_aff-g_acq-partners_program&utm_source=aid-tune-%7Baffiliate_id%7D&utm_medium=link&utm_term=vpn_home_plans_offer_hfp_landing&utm_content=%7Boffer_id%7D&hfp=true&phfp=true&spl=%7Baffiliate_id%7D&aap=%7Baffiliate_id%7D" >View now at Proton <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1199476&u=4338022&m=80525&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/pyx40e" >LogMeOnce Best free password manager for extra features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>LogMeOnce&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices</li><li>Security audit report included on free tier</li><li>Can assign a beneficiary for your logins</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Outdated interface and clunky setup process</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p>LogMeOnce is a decent password manager with some interesting offerings on its ad-supported free tier, but it’s not as user-friendly as other tools we recommend. You get unlimited password synching across unlimited devices and multi-platform access on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer, and Safari. </p><p>Several extra features that set LogMeOnce apart, including a security scorecard, which tracks password strength and usage, and the option to assign a beneficiary who can access your logins in an emergency. The free plan also includes limited file and note storage, password sharing, and credit card credential storage. </p><p>LogMeOnce isn’t intuitive to use, however. The interface is outdated, and the process to download and set up apps and extensions is clunky (in testing, the mobile app repeatedly asked for credentials and froze multiple times). There is also no MFA support on the free tier, although you can enable 2FA via email or Google Authenticator to access your vault. </p><p>LogMeOnce is a good option for users who don’t mind tinkering with all of its features and settings, or those who might want to upgrade to a paid plan for unique features like 2FA via selfie and the ability to grant emergency access via photo and GPS location. </p><p><strong>LogMeOnce features:</strong> Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure password sharing (up to 5) | Secure note storage (up to 3) | Password generator | Encrypted file storage (1 MB) | Biometric unlock | Two-factor authentication for vault | Vault security audit | Beneficiary for emergency access</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1199476&u=4338022&m=80525&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/pyx40e" >View now at LogMeOnce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-free-password-manager"><a href="#What-is-the-best-free-password-manager" class="headerlink" title="What is the best free password manager?"></a>What is the best free password manager?</h2><p>Bitwarden is our pick for the best free password manager thanks to its ease of use, approach to security, and unlimited password storage across unlimited devices and an extensive list of platforms. However, there are several other free password managers worthy of consideration.

Some of the best free password managers are also open source, meaning their code is available to review for security vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Device and password limits:</strong> Some premium password managers limit the number of passwords you can save and&#x2F;or the number of devices on which you can access your vault if you are on a free plan, while others offer unlimited storage and syncing.</li><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Most password managers work on major operating systems and popular browsers, but be sure to check that your selected tool is compatible with what you use.</li><li><strong>Premium features:</strong> At a minimum, you need a password manager that can store passwords and fill them on login pages. Some free plans also offer extras for improved privacy or ease of use, like email aliases, MFA support, and vault health reports.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977028">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977028.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977028">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977028.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977028%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977028/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-we-test-password-managers"><a href="#How-we-test-password-managers" class="headerlink" title="How we test password managers"></a>How we test password managers</h2><p>To select the best free password managers, we identified established and trusted password management services that offer no-cost tiers, narrowing down to the password managers with minimal or no limits on the number of logins that can be stored or devices that can be synced as well as those that work across most major platforms to meet the needs of a variety of users.

However, these tools typically work best within the browser or operating system they are built for, and they lack a lot of the features available in standalone password managers. They also handle encryption differently: for example, only Apple’s iCloud Keychain is end-to-end encrypted by default. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880940/19272" target="_top" id="1880940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880940/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-free-password-managers-to-consider"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-free-password-managers-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative free password managers to consider?"></a>Are there alternative free password managers to consider?</h2><p>While those willing to pay for password management have an abundance of choices, the list of truly free password managers is brief, and other premium services that do offer free tiers significantly limit the number of logins or devices (or both) available to users.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies.

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068432/7443" target="_top" id="2068432">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068432" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068432/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062447/7443" target="_top" id="1062447">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062447" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062447/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

The most secure password managers offer advanced encryption and use secure protocols to protect personal information when transferring from the service to your device and vice versa.**<br>*** Open source: Open source options should be considered as the software is transparent and open to outside auditing for security vulnerabilities.**<br>*** Storage: Another important consideration is storage capacity. While some password managers limit the number of passwords you can store, others offer unlimited storage, so you can add all your information without restrictions.**<br>*** Compatibility: It’s also essential to check if your preferred device is compatible with the password manager. The best options offer cross-platform compatibility, allowing you to access your data from multiple devices, including your computer, tablet, and mobile device.**</p><p><strong>## How did we choose these LastPass alternatives?</strong></p><p><strong>In putting together this list of the best password managers that would make great LastPass alternatives, we looked at third-party reviews and opinions from security experts. We also have hands-on experience with these password management tools, because that’s the only way to really get to know how usable a service like this actually is.</strong> </p><p><strong>Our descriptions are designed to help you decide on an alternative to LastPass, depending on your situation, needs, and budget. After you narrow down possible contenders, you should test them yourself to ensure they meet your expectations.</strong></p><p><strong>When it comes to selecting a new password manager, there are several crucial factors to consider. These are some of the key elements that have determined the best options:</strong></p><p>*** Customer reviews: We consider customer experiences to be one of the most important factors – even if a password manager is very secure, if usability is poor, it cannot be a great solution.**<br>*** Company reputation: As you will be trusting an organization to provide a secure lockbox for your credentials, we only include reputable vendors who perform frequent security audits.**<br>*** Use cases: We wanted to include a range of LastPass alternatives suitable for consumer and business use cases and purposes.**<br>*** Price: Lastly, while some password managers are free, others may require a paid subscription to access all features. It’s important to weigh the cost against the benefits and select a password manager that meets your budget and feature requirements.**</p><p><strong>## How hard is it to move from one password manager to another?</strong></p><p><strong>Not hard at all. Most services offer ways to export your data as a CSV (Comma Separated Variable) file that can be imported into your destination service.</strong></p><p><strong>How this is done depends on the service you’re moving from and to. Information on how to export a CSV file out of LastPass can be found on <a class="link"   href="https://support.lastpass.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&bundleId=lastpass&topicId=LastPass/export-generic-csv.html&_LANG=enus" >LastPass’ support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you’re finished with your old service, don’t forget to delete your account after you’ve made your transfer.</strong></p><p><strong>## What is LastPass?</strong></p><p><strong>LastPass is a password manager that stores your passwords online so they can be accessed across your various devices. LastPass supports millions of users and its slogan is. “Prepare for a password[less] future by embracing pervasive password management today.”</strong></p><p><strong>## How do password managers work?</strong></p><p><strong>Different password managers have different user experiences and different feature sets, but all offer subscribers a similar set of core features:</strong> </p><p>*** A password generator.**<br>*** Secure sharing of passwords with trusted contacts.**<br>*** Form filling, including the option to automatically enter credit card details.**<br>*** Secure notes.**<br>*** A sync engine that replicates the database across devices, using a cloud service or a local host.**<br>*** Sometimes, a data breach scanner may be included to alert you to compromised credentials.**</p><p><strong>## Are password managers 100% safe?</strong></p><p><strong>No password manager, or software in general, can be considered 100% safe. Unfortunately, security incidents happen and data breaches occur on a daily basis – but the best password managers will utilize high levels of encryption (such as AES-256 encryption) and will not store your data centrally to prevent your credentials from falling into the wrong hands.</strong> </p><p><strong>## Can a password manager be hacked?</strong></p><p><strong>While no system is completely invulnerable to hacking, the best password managers use strong encryption algorithms and other security measures to protect your data. They also require a strong master password or passphrase to access your account. It is important to use a unique and complex master password and enable two-factor authentication to increase security further.</strong></p><p><strong>## What about going passwordless?</strong></p><p><strong>Passwords may, one day, become a thing of the past, although we have a long way to go. Passwordless <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-make-a-new-commitment-for-a-passwordless-future/" >authentication systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are linked most commonly to the FIDO Alliance, which promotes an open standard of passwordless authentication using passkeys. Passkeys are encrypted, safer than passwords, and use a key pair to authenticate at the time of a sign-in request, of which only you have the private key.</strong> </p><p><strong>## Are there any other LastPass alternatives worth considering?</strong></p><p><strong>If none of the above recommendations suit your needs, we have researched and listed several alternative password managers below.</strong></p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1199476&u=4338022&m=80525&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/752oeg" >Best free alternative LogMeOnce LogMeOnce offers a free ad-supported service that offers unlimited passwords across unlimited devices.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100537/7443" target="_top" id="2100537">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100537" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100537/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135364/19272" target="_top" id="2135364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135364/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049379/7443" target="_top" id="2049379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136617/26400" target="_top" id="2136617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136617/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902273/19272" target="_top" id="1902273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902273/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002019/7443" target="_top" id="2002019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002019/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134244/18498" target="_top" id="2134244">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134244" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134244/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows.

But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023.

That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080342/19272" target="_top" id="2080342">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080342" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080342/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows.

But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144275/7443" target="_top" id="2144275">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144275" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144275/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139108/17108" target="_top" id="2139108">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139108" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139108/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136548/16384" target="_top" id="2136548">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136548" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136548/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released.

How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

You’ll be able to use either Face ID or Touch ID to automatically fill in your log in information when accessing apps, websites, and programs on your iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or iMac device. </p><p>Passkeys can better protect your accounts from phishing scams or unauthorized access because they are encrypted, unlike passwords which can be cracked with specialized software or easily guessed with just a few extra bits of personal information. Apple also claims that Passkeys cannot be phished or leaked since they never leave the device they were created on. This means that hackers and scammers can’t trick you into sharing your Passkey with a fake log in portal or scrape your information from a remote server. </p><p>CNET</p><p>Apple also has plans for Passkeys to work across Android, Linux, and Windows platforms so you can use your iPhone or iPad to log into your accounts on non-iOS or non-macOS devices. That would make checking in at your doctor’s office or paying for grocery orders much faster, easier, and more secure. </p><h4 id="First-look-Apple’s-WWDC-2022-in-pictures"><a href="#First-look-Apple’s-WWDC-2022-in-pictures" class="headerlink" title="First look: Apple’s WWDC 2022 in pictures"></a>First look: Apple’s WWDC 2022 in pictures</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/1/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/2/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/3/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/4/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/5/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/6/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/7/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/8/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/9/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/10/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/11/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/12/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/13/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/14/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/first-look-apples-wwdc-2022-in-pictures/15/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>◀ </p><p>But before you throw out all those sticky notes and unsubscribe from your <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" >password manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, developers still need time to integrate Passkeys into their websites, programs, and applications. And once they do, you’ll be able to use one Passkey across all of your devices and accounts for faster, more secure log-ins.
