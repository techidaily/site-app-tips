 Dragon iTunes visualizer is vivid and colorful one. It will show what looks like a dragon slithering around. The movement of dragon has significant connection with the music. If the tempo music is quick, dragon will be faster and more interesting to look at. Although it says a dragon, you can never see the whole body to make sure. Perhaps that's what makes it more mysterious.

The "flow" action is slow and smooth, and even though it doesn't seem to have much connection to the music playing it is still very relaxing to watch.
