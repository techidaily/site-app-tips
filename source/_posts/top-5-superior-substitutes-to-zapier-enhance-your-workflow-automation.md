### Why Look for Zapier Alternatives

 Zapier gives a simple way for users to create connections to automate tasks. However, with many similar automation tools offered on the market, Zapier is not a one-size-fits-all solution. There are some factors that may cause you to explore Zapier's competitors.

 Even though Zapier provides a vast library, it may not support the apps or services you use. It offers basic functions to intermediate automation. While for some intricate workflows, you need more advanced features. Zapier is not a free automation tool. It offers a free plan with limitations. You may be on a budget for extensive automation requirements. Before purchasing its expensive plan, you may prefer to try some alternatives.

Besides basic connections, it allows integration with enterprise-level services and applications, such as Salesforce, SAP, NetSuite, and more. This Zapier alternative can create advanced workflows. Workato allows you to build complex workflows for specific business needs.

![Zapier Alternative Workato](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/zapier-alternatives/zapier-alternative-workato.jpg)

 One big advantage of Workato is its powerful data mapping capability. That ensures seamless data transfer between apps. Workato can deal with high volumes of data and complex workflows. So, it is a great automation tool for large organizations. Similar to Zapier, it offers specially designed security features for strict security requirements. However, Workato requires a steeper learning curve compared to Zapier. Because Workato is mainly used for enterprise clients, its price is more expensive than Zapier.

### Make

 Make (Integromat) is a powerful and user-friendly alternative to Zapier. This integration platform lets you handily connect applications and services. Like Zapier, Make connects many integrations, including apps, services, and even custom APIs. It is mainly designed to build complex workflows. Make enables you to easily create scenarios using its drag-and-drop functionality. You can transform and filter data within workflows with its data manipulation feature. It offers a free version to make 1,000 operations per month. Moreover, its paid plans are more affordable than Zapier.

 Make has a code editor that offers granular control. With the conditional logic and custom functions, it allows you to easily handle complex workflows.

### IFTTT

 IFTTT is a popular automation tool for businesses and homes. This Zapier alternative can connect to many apps and services. That covers the most popular tools for personal and basic business needs, even not as extensive as Zapier. Unlike Zapier, IFTTT creates Applets to customize and control your integrations.

![Zapier Alternative IFTTT](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/zapier-alternatives/zapier-alternative-ifttt.jpg)

### Pipedream

 If you are comfortable with code and prefer more flexibility for automation, Pipedream can be a strong alternative to Zapier. Unlike Zapier, it uses code (JavaScript) to define workflows. That brings more control and customization for developers. However, if you are new to automation and donâ€™t have much coding knowledge, you will find it hard to build your workflows. Pipedream is mainly designed to handle real-time events and data streams. That makes it perfect for creating complex workflows.

![Zapier Alternative Pipedream](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/zapier-alternatives/zapier-alternative-pipedream.jpg)

 Pipedream lets you make HTTP requests and utilize webhooks for integration. In that case, this Zapier alternative connects a wider range of apps and services. Moreover, you are allowed to build custom logic within your workflows. As an open-source platform, Pipedream has a collaborative community. However, the open-source nature also causes it less extensive official support.
