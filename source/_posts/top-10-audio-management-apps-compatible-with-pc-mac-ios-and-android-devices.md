### User's Evaluation of the PicPlayPost

 PicPlayPost review receives a lot of praise from its users according to the comment about the app. In creating a tribute slideshow, special events video presentation, and social media sharing, this app is an all-arounder, as many says. This app can be the go-to editor for quick movie creation for iOS users. With the transitions, effects, and filters, there is nothing more you can wish to add to the video editor if you want to do simple things.

 However, the app isn't built for professional use since it doesn't support significant editing features such as key chrome, motion detectors, and many more. But if the app you want to use is simple yet elegant on your mobile devices and capable of more than video editing, you better download and purchase it because it provides more than a default video editor can give you.

* An all-out video editor and maker to download on iOS and Android.
* The app supports a wide range of formats with different aspect ratios.
* It has improved audio ducking, adding audio clips and voiceover quickly.
* Attach animated text to the collage or video you have created.
* Bring your wallpaper to life with its Live Wallpaper feature.
* The app does support editing 30-mins videos.
