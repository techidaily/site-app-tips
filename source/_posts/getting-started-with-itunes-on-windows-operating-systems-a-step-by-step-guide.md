## How Do You Get Album Artwork on iTunes

 Album Artwork plays an important role for music. With it, iOS users can find and manage their music on iTunes easily.**iTunes** is awesome for playing the music on Windows computer and Mac computer when we purchased songs from iTunes Store or imported from MP3 CDs. We all know that, when we get songs with purchasing from iTunes Store, we can get all information of these songs. While, if you**get the album** by importing from CDs, the album artwork doesn't come with it. The result is, some of your music will show the good-looking artworks, some others will not.

1 Sign into the iTunes Store with your iTunes Account. ([iTunes password forgot](https://tools.techidaily.com/) ? Fix it)

7 You can get the album artworks on iTunes.

### The second way to get album artworks – from Google

Then refer to the Point 6 of the first way to get album artworks.

There are two points you need to pay attention to:

1 Save your picture as .jpg format

2 Save the full sized image, or the image will be blurry.
