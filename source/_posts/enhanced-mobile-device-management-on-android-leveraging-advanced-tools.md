### What is GoPro Quik?

 Quik proves that video editing can be done even by being unprofessional, which is why GoPro Quik has been developed. The app can be downloaded on Android and iOS devices for quick video editing, curating, and sharing with others on the internet. Since the app offers video editing, everyone can directly sync everything captured using the device. Often, the app is used to edit GoPro films that are transferred to another device so they can be polished. You can match the videos through the soundtracks generated on the app or the music downloaded into your device.

## Part 2\. GoPro Quik Evaluation from Users Perspective, Features, and Best Used for

### Users Evaluation of the GoPro Quik

 Quik fixes some bugs and glitches that are happening on the app. With the current updated version of it, the app provides more options and unique toolkits for everyone to enjoy in editing. Still, most of the update focuses on its functionality and performance. Overall, the app provides the quickest way to edit, for it has a built-in automatic editor that processes the video users select.

 When the video you edited on the GoPro Quik app is finished, you can export the final output to your choice. You can set it to the highest that the app supports; however, the file size of it will become enormous, and it is not space-friendly, so you will need to shrink the video file size.

5\. Share the Output to Different Social Media
