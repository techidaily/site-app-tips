### Make

 Make (Integromat) is a powerful and user-friendly alternative to Zapier. This integration platform lets you handily connect applications and services. Like Zapier, Make connects many integrations, including apps, services, and even custom APIs. It is mainly designed to build complex workflows. Make enables you to easily create scenarios using its drag-and-drop functionality. You can transform and filter data within workflows with its data manipulation feature.

### IFTTT

 IFTTT is a popular automation tool for businesses and homes. This Zapier alternative can connect to many apps and services.

Moreover, IFTTT has a large community where you can access various pre-built Applets created by others. This connectivity platform also offers mobile apps to create integrated and connected services. Compared with Zapier, it carries fewer functions and is not ideal for complex workflows.

### Pipedream

 If you are comfortable with code and prefer more flexibility for automation, Pipedream can be a strong alternative to Zapier. Unlike Zapier, it uses code (JavaScript) to define workflows. That brings more control and customization for developers. However, if you are new to automation and donâ€™t have much coding knowledge, you will find it hard to build your workflows. Pipedream is mainly designed to handle real-time events and data streams. That makes it perfect for creating complex workflows.

Moreover, you are allowed to build custom logic within your workflows. As an open-source platform, Pipedream has a collaborative community. However, the open-source nature also causes it less extensive official support.
