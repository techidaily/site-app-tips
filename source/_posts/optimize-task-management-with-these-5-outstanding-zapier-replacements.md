### Why Look for Zapier Alternatives

 Zapier gives a simple way for users to create connections to automate tasks. However, with many similar automation tools offered on the market, Zapier is not a one-size-fits-all solution. There are some factors that may cause you to explore Zapier's competitors.

 Even though Zapier provides a vast library, it may not support the apps or services you use. It offers basic functions to intermediate automation. While for some intricate workflows, you need more advanced features. Zapier is not a free automation tool. It offers a free plan with limitations. You may be on a budget for extensive automation requirements. Before purchasing its expensive plan, you may prefer to try some alternatives.

## Part 2\. Check the 5 Best Zapier Alternatives

 If you prefer trying some automation alternatives before purchasing Zapier, you can check the five contenders below. You can compare their features, pros, cons, prices, and other factors to make your final decision.

### Workato

Workato allows you to build complex workflows for specific business needs.

![Zapier Alternative Workato](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/zapier-alternatives/zapier-alternative-workato.jpg)

 One big advantage of Workato is its powerful data mapping capability. That ensures seamless data transfer between apps. Workato can deal with high volumes of data and complex workflows. So, it is a great automation tool for large organizations. Similar to Zapier, it offers specially designed security features for strict security requirements. However, Workato requires a steeper learning curve compared to Zapier. Because Workato is mainly used for enterprise clients, its price is more expensive than Zapier.

### Make

 Make (Integromat) is a powerful and user-friendly alternative to Zapier. This integration platform lets you handily connect applications and services. Like Zapier, Make connects many integrations, including apps, services, and even custom APIs. It is mainly designed to build complex workflows. Make enables you to easily create scenarios using its drag-and-drop functionality. You can transform and filter data within workflows with its data manipulation feature. It offers a free version to make 1,000 operations per month. Moreover, its paid plans are more affordable than Zapier.

Compared with Zapier, it carries fewer functions and is not ideal for complex workflows.

### Pipedream

 If you are comfortable with code and prefer more flexibility for automation, Pipedream can be a strong alternative to Zapier. Unlike Zapier, it uses code (JavaScript) to define workflows.

Pipedream is mainly designed to handle real-time events and data streams. That makes it perfect for creating complex workflows.

![Zapier Alternative Pipedream](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/zapier-alternatives/zapier-alternative-pipedream.jpg)

 Pipedream lets you make HTTP requests and utilize webhooks for integration. In that case, this Zapier alternative connects a wider range of apps and services. Moreover, you are allowed to build custom logic within your workflows. As an open-source platform, Pipedream has a collaborative community. However, the open-source nature also causes it less extensive official support.
