## From LastPass to iCloud: Transition Your Passwords Securely on PC - Expert Tips From ZDNet

![iCloud window on a Windows laptop.](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/34d8b8531fe183d0264c25d2ec634a143db7c725/2022/09/21/eaca28ea-e2c3-46f5-b07a-401e49afd43a/icloud-windows.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

iCloud for Windows can become your new password manager.

An [Apple ID](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-friends-could-help-stop-you-getting-locked-out-of-your-apple-id/) gives you access to many perks within the Apple software ecosystem, and one of them is [Keychain](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-locate-a-password-with-the-macos-keychain/): iCloud's password manager. 

### **ZDNET** Recommends

[The best password manager: Business and personal use Everyone needs a password manager. If you're willing to pay a monthly or annual fee, these options are worth it.  Read now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/)

Whether you use Keychain already or are in the market for a new password manager for your Windows computer after your [free trial of LastPass](https://lastpass.wo8g.net/c/159047/506709/8692?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) expired, using [iCloud](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-back-up-iphone-with-icloud-or-mac/) as a password manager is possible not only on MacOS devices but also on Windows PCs.

If you've been around for the past 10 or so years, you know that most services require accounts set up to access them. This means that we end up with dozens of passwords that we somehow have to remember for each one of those accounts. 

**Also:** [**The 10 best Windows laptops, 2-in-1s, and ultraportables**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-windows-laptop/)

But how can I remember all these passwords if I can't even remember my significant other's phone number half the time?

## How to use iCloud as a password manager on Windows

## 1\. Open iCloud for Windows

Go to your Start menu and open iCloud for Windows. Adding iCloud for Windows to your computer lets you manage your passwords from your PC and generate verification codes when an account needs [two-factor authentication](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-factor-authentication-is-a-great-idea-but-not-enough-people-are-using-it/) (2FA).

Make sure you have [downloaded iCloud for your Windows PC](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/icloud/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-us&gl=us). 

Go to the Start menu and open iCloud for Windows.

## 2\. Sign in to your iCloud Passwords

Once you sign in to your account -- if you haven't already -- you can access your account, add another account, and make any necessary changes.

Go to Passwords, and click Apply.

Sign in with your Apple ID and password.

## 3\. Make sure Passwords is on and click Apply

Make sure Passwords is selected on the iCloud window, then click on **Apply** to make the changes. 

You can also install browser extensions at this point.

Make sure Passwords is on and click **Apply**.

## 4\. Add browser extension

At this point, you can also add a browser extension to [Google Chrome](https://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-google-chrome-extensions-affect-1-4-million-users/) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/beef-up-microsoft-edge-with-my-favorite-add-ons/) by following the instructions in the iCloud for Windows app. 

Once you click **Install Extension** in iCloud, you'll be able to add the **iCloud Passwords** extension in Chrome.

## 5\. Enable Autofill on Chrome

Since I added the [Google Chrome extension](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-chrome-extension/), the next step is to **Enable Autofill** to give Chrome permission to my iCloud Passwords.

To do this, click on the Keychain button on the toolbar (marked with an arrow on the image below).

Enabling Autofill will prompt 2FA with your Apple device. You can see my phone (second image below) is asking me to allow another PC to access my account, and then it will provide a verification code to enter on the Windows PC.

Enable Autofill.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

Enter the verification code.

## 6\. Try out the password manager

After you set up iCloud for [Windows](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-22h2-how-to-get-microsofts-latest-os-update-and-whats-coming-next/) as a password manager and your browser extension, you can try it out by going to a website and trying to log in.

The iCloud Passwords icon is enabled and you can let it autofill your passwords.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

Like LastPass, the browser extension will let you fill in your login information.

##  How do I set up iCloud Keychain? 

iCloud Keychain is available for your [Apple devices](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-update-all-of-your-apple-devices/): [iPhone](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [iPad](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and [Mac](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). To set it up, go to your iPhone's Settings and tap on your name at the top of the screen to access your iCloud settings. Then, choose iCloud.

##  Can I use LastPass for free? 

LastPass changed the terms on its free option, so that someone with a free account can only use the password manager on one device. This means that you'd need a subscription to use LastPass on both your iPhone and your Windows PC, for example. So, while you can use LastPass for free on your iPhone and iPad, the free version won't be also available for your Windows PC. This is why using iCloud Passwords for Windows is the best free option.
