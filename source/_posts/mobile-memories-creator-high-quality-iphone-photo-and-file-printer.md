### Evaluation of InShot from a Users Perspective

 InShot app provides everything a typical mobile video editor needs to process their videos on their portable devices. The app performs tremendously, and with its newest update, some bugs are fixed, and developers improve the app to become even better, which is excellent for editors. Even for beginners who want to edit, downloading the app can be a great addition to their arsenal of video editing apps on mobile devices.

 Thus far, the app isn't the best choice for layering or adding multiple videos and audio tracks, for the app only supports a single timeline which limits the creativity of its users. Even if the app can't reach that demand, it is still considered one of the best apps to download on mobile phones for video editing for some time now.
