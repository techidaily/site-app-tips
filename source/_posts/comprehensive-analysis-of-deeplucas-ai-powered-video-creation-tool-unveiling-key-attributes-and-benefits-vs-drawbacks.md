## Part 1\. Deep Review of Lucas AI Text to Video Generator

 Developed by Idomoo company, Lucas AI Video Creator is a highly advanced AI text-to-video tool. It changes the way of taking videos and allows you to produce videos with some simple prompts. What Lucas AI Video Creator makes are simple videos with only one scene. They combine multiple scenes, words, video narrators and background music. In my view, videos generated by Lucas AI Video Creator are best for promotion, advertising, and explanation.

### Main features

1\. Comprehensive Video Creation

 Lucas AI Video Creator will make a video with a full set of relevant preparations. Instead of directly offering you the video, it first analyzes your text and makes a full script with the Title and content description of each scene. Its voice-over also saves you a lot of time post-producing.

 Before Lucas AI makes a video script out of your text, you can change the video length according to your needs. You have 6 options between 20 seconds to 2 minutes.

 If you are not satisfied with the video Lucas AI just made, you still have a chance to edit. You can adjust the color palette, language, narrator, and music. You can also change the text shown on the video. You are also allowed to upload your media to replace the video clips and narration to make the video stylish.

4\. Interactive CTA

 When creating videos for explainer videos or advertisements, a call-to-action button can simply increase audience engagement. You can leave URLs, Tel, and Emails on your video so that the viewer can easily get more information and contact you if they need it.

### Price

 Lucas AI Video Creator is totally free to use. You can make and edit videos as much as you want. But all the videos will contain a watermark. You need to pay $5 to download a video without watermarks. However, I don’t find any choice of downloading videos with watermarks. You can only watch the video online.

For enterprise use, you need to contact sales to learn about the price.

* The Lucas AI sometimes can’t understand language sometime.

How do you use Lucas AI?

 Using Lucas AI to create videos is very easy. First, open the idomoo.ai website on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc. Then click the button labeled Try Lucas For Free.

At last, click Create and wait for the AI video to appear at the bottom.

 You need to pay $5 for each video if you want to download it to your local disk without watermarks.

Will Lucas generate weird videos?

 Unfortunately, there isn’t an exact answer to whether it will create weird videos. But according to my test, the answer is no. During the test, I found that if you input some extremely inappropriate text, Lucas AI will stick in waiting forever. And when I create a video with the prompt: two people fight violently, it creates a video of the war history.

Conclusion

**Lucas AI Video Creator** is a great tool to make videos out of text. It can save a lot of time and money. But it still has some drawbacks, and the biggest one is that the videos generated by Lucas AI are all in the same style.
