## Part 1\. What Is AI Video Colorization

 Before showing specific AI tools, I want to talk about how this AI colorization technology works and the benefits it offers.

 AI video colorization relies on machine learning to transform black and white content. Deep learning algorithms can analyze objects, scenes, skin tones, and other elements of black and white footage and intelligently fill them with the most likely colors.

### How Does AI Colorize Video Work

 These AI algorithms are trained on vast amounts of color data and corresponding black and white versions. While analyzing your video and comparing it with paired examples, it can easily identify objects, shapes, and shadows and colorize them. The AI video colorization tool usually divides your video into individual frames and then transforms them into color ones frame by frame.

Moreover, AI colorization can make old resources more accessible to researchers. For personal usage, creative exploration, and other reasons, you may also want to colorize your videos using AI. However, you should know that AI and deep learning technologies are still developing, and video colorization accuracy may vary.
