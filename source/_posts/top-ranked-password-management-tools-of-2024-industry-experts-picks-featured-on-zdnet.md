## Factors to consider when choosing a password manager

There is a huge range of password managers on the market today. To help you make the right decision, you should consider the factors below.

* **Security:** Security is the foremost priority when it comes to password managers. The most secure password managers offer advanced encryption and use secure protocols to protect personal information when transferring from the service to your device and vice versa.
* **Storage:** Another important consideration is storage capacity. While some password managers limit the number of passwords you can store, others offer unlimited storage so that you can add all your information without restrictions.
* **Compatibility:** It's also essential to check if your preferred device is compatible with the password manager. The best options offer cross-platform compatibility, allowing you to access your data from multiple devices, including your computer, tablet, and mobile device.
* **Accounts**: If you want to assign more than one identity or online account to a person, consider whether or not the family (or business) accounts are value for money.

## How did we choose the best password managers? 

In compiling this list of the best password managers, we examined third-party reviews and opinions from security experts. We also have hands-on experience with these password management tools because that's the only way to really get to know how usable a service is. 

When selecting the best password manager, several crucial factors must be considered. These are some of the key elements that determine the best options:

* **Price:** While some password managers are free, others may require a paid subscription to access all features. It's important to weigh the cost against the benefits and select a password manager that meets your budget.
* **Customer reviews**: Customer experiences and feedback are very important. If usability is overlooked, it really doesn't matter how secure or exceptional a password manager is. We consider customer reviews and ease of use as one of our most important criteria.
* **Company reputation**: As you will be trusting an organization to provide a secure lockbox for your credentials, we only include reputable vendors who perform frequent security audits.
* **Use cases**: We wanted to include a range of password managers suitable for consumer and business use cases and purposes.

## How does a password manager work?

Password managers are digital tools that can help you keep track of all your passwords and other sensitive information in a safe and organized manner. Once you create an account with a password manager, you can add your login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data into the password vault. You can add this information all at once or over time as you use different websites or apps.

The password manager will then store all your data in an encrypted format, making it extremely difficult for hackers to decipher. Whenever you visit a site or use an app requiring login credentials, the password manager can automatically fill in your username and password for you. This feature can save you a lot of time and hassle, especially if you have many different accounts to manage.

Another feature of the best password managers is the ability to generate strong passwords. These passwords are typically long and random, making them more difficult to guess or crack. Password managers can create and store these complex passwords for you, making it much easier to keep your accounts secure. 

Password managers can be invaluable for anyone who wants to keep their online accounts safe and secure.

## Do I need a password manager?

In today's digital age, almost everything we do requires a password, from social media to online banking, and it can be challenging to remember all the different passwords we create. The best way to manage these passwords is by using a password manager. Not only does it store your passwords in a central location, but it also provides strong encryption to keep your data safe from cybercriminals.

Using a password manager can also help prevent attacks and data breaches that expose your information to the wrong eyes. Cybercriminals use various methods to gain access to your passwords, from phishing attacks to brute-force attacks. Using a password manager, you can create strong, unique passwords for each account, reducing the risk of being hacked. Alternatively, some browsers, such as Google Chrome, will offer built-in password managers.

## Are password managers safe?

Yes, password managers are safe as they use advanced encryption algorithms to protect your login credentials. When you use a password manager, your passwords are stored in an encrypted form, which means they can't be accessed by anyone without the correct password or passphrase. 

However, it is important to choose a reputable password manager and use a strong, unique password or passphrase to protect your account. You should also remember there's no such thing as a 100% secure service, and on occasion, even the best password managers may have to patch and fix security vulnerabilities. 

## Can a password manager be hacked?

While no system is completely invulnerable to hacking, the best password managers use strong encryption algorithms and other security measures to protect your data. They also require a strong master password or passphrase to access your account. It is important to use a unique and complex master password and enable two-factor authentication to increase security further.

## Can I use a password manager on multiple devices?

Yes, most password managers allow you to use your account on multiple devices, such as your computer, smartphone, or tablet. This means you can access your passwords and other login credentials from anywhere at any time.

## What are passwordless options?

Passwords may, one day, become a thing of the past, although we have a long way to go. Passwordless [authentication systems](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-make-a-new-commitment-for-a-passwordless-future/) are linked most commonly to the FIDO Alliance, which promotes an open standard of passwordless authentication using passkeys. Passkeys are encrypted, safer than passwords, and use a key pair to authenticate at the time of a sign-in request, of which only you have the private key. 

## Are there alternative password managers worth considering?

While we've aimed to showcase the best password managers in 2024, it isn't possible to highlight every worthy option on the market. In our search, we've also found other password managers that did not make the top list but are certainly worth exploring, as listed below.
