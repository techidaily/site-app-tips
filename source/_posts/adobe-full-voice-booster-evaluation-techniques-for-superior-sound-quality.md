## Part 3\. FAQs of Adobe Voice Enhancer

 Is Audacity better than Adobe Audition vocal enhancer?

 Audacity is free and open source, and that can be a good choice for beginners or those on a budget. It offers basic noise reduction and equalization options to enhance vocals. However, compared with Adobe Audition, it carries fewer voice enhancement features. Adobe Audition is a professional audio editor that provides various effects and presets to improve vocal quality. Moreover, it is designed with more precise control for audio editing and recording. Audition requires a steeper learning curve to access and master various functions. The annual plan of Audition costs $22.99/month. So, if you only need some basic vocal enhancement features, you can start with Audacity.

 Does Adobe Voice Enhancer work with any audio file?

 No, Adobe Voice Enhancer (Adobe Podcast Enhance Speech) currently only supports MP3 and WAV. It can enhance voice files stored in other audio formats.

 How do you amplify your voice in Adobe Audition?

 Adobe Audition offers two main solutions to amplify your voice. The most straightforward method is to raise the volume of your audio through Amplify. You can add your vocal clip to Audition, go to Effects, click Amplitude and Compression, and then select the Amplify option. Locate the Gain slider and drag it to increase the volume. Also, you can rely on the Normalize effect to boost your voice. You can access it under Amplitude and Compression. Adjust the Normalize value to make your voice sound louder.

 Is Enhance Speech in Adobe Podcast the same as in Premiere Pro?

 Yes. The Enhance Speech tool was once only accessible through the Adobe Podcast beta program. But now it is also available in Premiere Pro. It offers the same vocal enhancement feature.

Conclusion

 If you are searching for a free and easy way to enhance audio, you can try using**Adobe Voice Enhancer** to reduce background noise and improve vocal clarity. Its ease of use and advanced AI vocal enhancement capabilities make Enhance Speech a good option to enhance voices, for both casual users and professionals.
