### Users Evaluation of the GoPro Quik

 Quik fixes some bugs and glitches that are happening on the app. With the current updated version of it, the app provides more options and unique toolkits for everyone to enjoy in editing. Still, most of the update focuses on its functionality and performance. Overall, the app provides the quickest way to edit, for it has a built-in automatic editor that processes the video users select. Yet, the auto edit only provides basic video editing that isn't suitable for users who want a detailed video. Manually doing it would be better.

### Key Features of GoPro Quik

1\. Auto Video Editing

 Due to the practical automated video editing function that the app provides, editing and processing the app will not be a problem for you. However, this option is only available once you avail of a plan on the app, and if you are using the free version, the app will allow you to do basic manual video editing. Also, these features aren't available on the computer version and only on mobile device versions.

2\. Speed Ramping Option

 Changing the video speed has been a problem for many users, but when you use this app, changing the video speed wouldn't be a fuzz for the app. It can go up or down and alter the video speed based on your preferences.

3\. Get the Highest Output Resolution

 When the video you edited on the GoPro Quik app is finished, you can export the final output to your choice. You can set it to the highest that the app supports; however, the file size of it will become enormous, and it is not space-friendly, so you will need to shrink the video file size.

4\. Pre-made Themes and Filters

 Aside from the features that we mentioned above, here, you can use the pre-made filters that are currently available. Though these filters and themes are commonly used on different video editors, it is still great to use all of these to add suspense or emotions to the video you are editing.

5\. Share the Output to Different Social Media

 Save the final output and be ready to share it with the world. You do not need to leave the application or close it down before you can post or share the final output.

6\. One of the Largest Cloud Storage

 Store all the edited videos or images in its cloud instead of your hard drive to save some space. This option is only available when you purchase the application, and it isn't accessible once you use the free version of it.

It has the speed to edit videos automatically without degrading the overall quality of the video. The app is simple to use, and even beginners in video editing wouldn't find trouble manipulating some options that this app has.
