## The best free password managers of 2024

[Bitwarden Best free password manager overall](https://bitwarden.com/) 

Bitwarden/ZDNET

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Syncs unlimited passwords on unlimited devices
* Open source
* Passkey support
* Data breach reporting

**Cons** 
* Premium features such as emergency access require paid plan

More Details 

Bitwarden offers everything you need in a basic password manager -- plus some premium features -- at no cost, which makes it our top pick for free password management (and [one of our favorite password managers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-bitwarden-features-that-make-it-my-favorite-password-manager/), period). 

Users on Bitwarden's free tier can create and store an unlimited number of logins that sync across an unlimited number of devices with access wherever you need them: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android as well as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Vivaldi, Edge, Brave, Opera, Tor, and DuckDuckGo (currently in beta on macOS). The free plan also includes useful tools like encrypted text sharing via Bitwarden Send, the ability to share vault items with another user, and a handful of multi-factor authentication (MFA) options for accessing your vault. 

Bitwarden is open source, meaning its code is available for anyone to identify security flaws that need to be patched, and the platform undergoes regular security audits and testing. It also supports passkeys both for saved logins and access to your Bitwarden vault, adding a layer of security beyond even a complex password and two-factor authentication. The free tier also includes basic vault health reporting, so you'll be alerted if any of your saved usernames were exposed in a data breach. 

Bitwarden has a no-frills interface, and some of its features -- like autofill and its built-in password generator -- are clunkier than other platforms. But as a completely free password manager, it's a solid choice for most people. 

**Bitwarden features:** Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure vault sharing between two users | Secure note storage | Password generator | Encrypted text sharing via Bitwarden Send | Passkey support | Biometric unlock | Multi-factor authentication for vault | Username data breach reports

[NordPass Best free password manager for new users](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://nordpass.com/) 

Nord/ZDNET

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Unlimited password storage
* Clean, consistent user interface
* Passkey support

**Cons** 
* Can only be logged in on one device at a time

More Details 

NordPass is the password manager from Nord Security, the cybersecurity company behind [NordVPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nordvpn-review/) and secure cloud storage service NordLocker. Its free tier offers the essentials of password management: unlimited password storage with autosave and autofill, a built-in password generator, and passkey support, all in a user-friendly interface that's consistent across platforms. 

NordPass's most significant limitation is that you can only be logged into your vault on one device at a time -- accessing your account via mobile app will log you out on desktop, and vice versa. This is more of a minor inconvenience for most users, as it simply requires logging back into your vault using your master password, biometrics, or one-time code when you switch devices. NordPass is multi-platform, with apps for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux and extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge. 

While signing up for NordPass does require you to create a universal Nord Account login in addition to a master password for your vault, you can access all of Nord Security's tools under the same credentials. Like other trusted password managers, NordPass uses strong encryption and has undergone an independent security audit. You can also enable multi-factor authentication as an extra measure to protect your vault. 

NordPass's intuitive platform on its free tier is a good choice for users new to password management who don't mind having to log in with each device switch. Note, though, that if you want any extra features like security monitoring, file storage, or emergency access, you'll need to upgrade to a paid account, which starts at $1.39 per month for a single user. 

**NordPass features:** Unlimited passwords on one device at a time | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure note storage | Username and password generator | Passkey support | Biometric unlock | Multi-factor authentication for vault | 24/7 customer support

[Proton Pass Best free password manager for privacy](https://go.getproton.me/aff%5Fc?offer%5Fid=26&aff%5Fid=4706&source=ZDNET&aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fproton.me%2Fpass%2F%3FvisitorId%3Dho-{transaction%5Fid}%26aid%3D{affiliate%5Fid}%26offer%5Fid%3D{offer%5Fid}%26url%5Fid%3D{offer%5Furl%5Fid}%26utm%5Fcampaign%3Dww-all-2c-vpn-gro%5Faff-g%5Facq-partners%5Fprogram%26utm%5Fsource%3Daid-tune-{affiliate%5Fid}%26utm%5Fmedium%3Dlink%26utm%5Fterm%3Dvpn%5Fhome%5Fplans%5Foffer%5Fhfp%5Flanding%26utm%5Fcontent%3D{offer%5Fid}%26hfp%3Dtrue%26phfp%3Dtrue%26spl%3D{affiliate%5Fid}%26aap%3D{affiliate%5Fid}) 

Proton Pass/ZDNET

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices
* 10 hide-my-email aliases included
* Basic security monitoring with Pass Monitor
* Open source

**Cons** 
* Integrated 2FA limited to three logins

More Details 

Proton Pass is an open-source password manager that combines highly secure storage with premium features for all users, including those on its free tier. With a free account, you get unlimited password storage accessible on an unlimited number of devices and across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, and Edge. Proton Pass has a user-friendly design and a simple, guided setup process, making it a solid alternative to NordPass for those new to password management. 

A free Proton Pass account includes several features usually found only on paid plans. You get up to 10 hide-my-email aliases, which can minimize tracking and spam tied to your personal address, and vault health reports as part of Pass Monitor. Proton Pass does offer integrated two-factor authentication support, but this is limited to three accounts unless you upgrade to a premium tier. 

As the password management solution from Proton, the Swiss privacy company known for its VPN and encrypted email services, Proton Pass meets high security standards. Like Bitwarden, its code is available for independent review, and the platform undergoes audits that are made available to the public. 

If you are looking for a well-designed and highly secure password manager with a handful of unique features, Proton Pass is worthy of consideration. 

**Proton Pass features:** Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure password sharing | Integrated two-factor authentication (up to 3 logins) | Hide-my-email aliases (up to 10) | Password generator | Password health reports | Passkey support | Biometric unlock on mobile

[LogMeOnce Best free password manager for extra features](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1199476&u=4338022&m=80525&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fcowinaudio.pxf.io%2Fpyx40e) 

LogMeOnce/ZDNET

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices
* Security audit report included on free tier
* Can assign a beneficiary for your logins

**Cons** 
* Outdated interface and clunky setup process

More Details 

LogMeOnce is a decent password manager with some interesting offerings on its ad-supported free tier, but it's not as user-friendly as other tools we recommend. You get unlimited password synching across unlimited devices and multi-platform access on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer, and Safari. 

Several extra features that set LogMeOnce apart, including a security scorecard, which tracks password strength and usage, and the option to assign a beneficiary who can access your logins in an emergency. The free plan also includes limited file and note storage, password sharing, and credit card credential storage. 

LogMeOnce isn't intuitive to use, however. The interface is outdated, and the process to download and set up apps and extensions is clunky (in testing, the mobile app repeatedly asked for credentials and froze multiple times). There is also no MFA support on the free tier, although you can enable 2FA via email or Google Authenticator to access your vault. 

LogMeOnce is a good option for users who don't mind tinkering with all of its features and settings, or those who might want to upgrade to a paid plan for unique features like 2FA via selfie and the ability to grant emergency access via photo and GPS location. 

**LogMeOnce features:** Unlimited passwords on unlimited devices | Multi-platform | Autofill and autosave | Secure password sharing (up to 5) | Secure note storage (up to 3) | Password generator | Encrypted file storage (1 MB) | Biometric unlock | Two-factor authentication for vault | Vault security audit | Beneficiary for emergency access

## Factors to consider when choosing a free password manager

When selecting a free password manager, consider the following factors: 

* **Security:** Good password managers have high levels of encryption and undergo regular security audits to ensure your data is kept safe and sound. Some of the best free password managers are also open source, meaning their code is available to review for security vulnerabilities.
* **Device and password limits:** Some premium password managers limit the number of passwords you can save and/or the number of devices on which you can access your vault if you are on a free plan, while others offer unlimited storage and syncing.
* **Compatibility:** Most password managers work on major operating systems and popular browsers, but be sure to check that your selected tool is compatible with what you use.
* **Premium features:** At a minimum, you need a password manager that can store passwords and fill them on login pages. Some free plans also offer extras for improved privacy or ease of use, like email aliases, MFA support, and vault health reports.

## How we test password managers

To select the best free password managers, we identified established and trusted password management services that offer no-cost tiers, narrowing down to the password managers with minimal or no limits on the number of logins that can be stored or devices that can be synced as well as those that work across most major platforms to meet the needs of a variety of users. We then did hands-on testing to determine ease of use and compare features, including the factors listed above.

## FAQs about free password managers

## Which password manager is the most secure?

All of the password managers listed here meet basic security standards, such as high levels of encryption and submission to independent audits, but Bitwarden and Proton Pass stand out thanks to their open-source code.

## Do security experts recommend password managers?

Security experts generally recommend using password managers to create and save strong, unique passwords that you can access across multiple devices as an alternative to reusing the same basic passwords over and over.

## What is the main risk of using a password manager?

While password managers can help improve password hygiene, [the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-the-password-manager-that-s-right-for-you) that they create a single point of access to your data, so you should also have a strong master password and multi-factor authentication set up for your vault. Some of the most popular password managers [have been vulnerable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2023/12/11/android-warning-1password-dashlane-lastpass-and-others-can-leak-passwords/) to data leaks and security breaches. 

## Should I use my browser's password manager? 

Your browser's built-in password manager is an easy entry point into creating and storing passwords, and it's probably better than not using any type of password manager at all. However, these tools typically work best within the browser or operating system they are built for, and they lack a lot of the features available in standalone password managers. They also handle encryption differently: for example, only Apple's iCloud Keychain is end-to-end encrypted by default.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Are there alternative free password managers to consider? 

While those willing to pay for password management have an abundance of choices, the list of truly free password managers is brief, and other premium services that do offer free tiers significantly limit the number of logins or devices (or both) available to users. That said, if none of our recommendations fit the bill, there are a few alternatives to consider. 

[Best alternative for tech-minded users KeePass KeePass is a free, open-source password manager that stores your data locally in an encrypted file on your Windows device (with unofficial ports to other platforms), but it is complex for the average user and lacks the updated features of most password management tools. View at KeePass](https://keepass.com/)[Best alternative for a single device RoboForm RoboForm offers unlimited passwords on one device with extras like data breach monitoring and time-based one-time password (TOTP) authentication.
