![Hugging Face Text to Video AI Models](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/hugging-face-text-to-video/hugging-face-text-to-video-ai-models.jpg)

AnimateDiff-Lightning is a lightning text-to-video generation model developed by ByteDance. It can create videos from text at 10x faster speeds compared to the source AnimateDiff model.

Text2Video-Zero requires no specific video training data. It uses pre-trained models to directly create high-quality videos from text. This AI model does not need extensive video datasets.

ali-vilab text-to-video-ms-1.7b uses a multi-stage diffusion to turn text into videos. The AI text-to-video generation model is primarily designed for research purposes. It currently only supports text in English.

ModelScope Text To Video Synthesis focuses on text-guided video-to-video generation. This model lets you generate new video content based on existing footage and text. In that case, this text-to-video model can automatically add narration, adjust effects, customize settings, and improve the overall video quality. It is mainly used for creating realistic and visually appealing videos. One thing you should be concerned about is that this model is currently restricted to non-commercial use.

### Pros and Cons of Hugging Face Text-to-Video AI Models

 Compared to traditional video creation methods, Hugging Face AI models can help to save time and resources. With suitable text-to-video models, you can easily create high-quality video content. Moreover, this new content creation way offers more possibilities for creative expression.

![Hugging Face Text to Video Models](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/hugging-face-text-to-video/hugging-face-text-to-video-models.jpg)

 However, most current AI models canâ€™t make real high-quality content. Complex and detailed text prompts may not be created in the video. The AI technology also causes potential misuse for disinformation. Moreover, compared with traditional video editing, text-to-video models may not offer the same level of artistic control.

## Part 2\. How to Use Hugging Face Text to Video Models

 Considering that there are many different models offered on the Hugging Face platform, when you want to turn text into video content, you should first select a desired text-to-video model. As a beginner, you can start with Text2Video-Zero. It is designed with a user-friendly interface and doesn't require specific video training data.

![Hugging Face AI Model Text2Video-Zero](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/hugging-face-text-to-video/hugging-face-ai-model-text2video-zero.jpg)

 Once you have chosen your text-to-video model, you can start to prepare your text prompt. Try inputting a clear text description to create your video. Surely, the more details you give, the better content you may get. Also, the AI model will take a longer time to process. After that, you can click the Play button to check the generated video.
