### Evaluation of the ShotCut from a Users Perspective

 Downloading ShotCut on Android and computer is an excellent pick-up for doing the intensive video editing that most professionals need. This app is correct to say that it is dynamic in terms of all editing it provides. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, using this app to produce high-quality video editing is an option you shouldn't miss out on. However, there are options on the interface that we find confusing to use, and not all of the features you can get on high-end video editors are presented on the app, even if you purchase a license to use it.

 Generally, the ShotCut app is a must to download on every device for quick video editing for presentations. It is considered in the tier of average video editor, which means it offers basics and some advanced video editing features.

### 7 Things You Must Know About the ShotCut Video Editor

1\. Wide Variety of Video Editing Options

 As an editor, it would be an excellent addition if the application had a[video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/) , overlays, background, changing speed, cut, and crop options other than the advanced options. While using ShotCut video editing, you can easily manipulate everything that we mentioned for the editing options.

2\. Aesthetic Video Effects and Filters

 Highlights, adding effects, and attraction are the significant advantages of this app. Its thousands of aesthetic filters and effects you can easily apply can play a vital part in your editing video. There is no need for you to become a pro to add one because you only need to tap or click the effects that you want to apply, and tada! You will apply the effects to the video.

3\. Music Editor

 Other ShotCut reviews should have highlighted that the app now has a music editor. Though the music editing option that it provides isn't as concise as the other music editor like Audacity. But the app's overall approach to editing music is much better than other editors you can use on the market.

4\. Animated Text

 Need to[add subtitles to the MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/) video you have created? Well, this app does produce high-quality animated text that you can use. Other than using it as a subtitle, you can also use the animated text for additional information that the audience can read. Adding text to a video can bring more views than a video.

5\. Share Final Output Globally

 Though the app isn't affiliated with other social media platforms, sharing the video you edited here on different platforms is still possible. You only need to log in, click the share button, and choose the platform where you want to share the video you created on this app.

6\. Easy-to-Use Video Editor

 Despite having advanced options and features, the app is still user-friendly, which means you can still manage to use the app even without a tutorial. However, when you need to do complicated editing like upscale ShotCut videos, you better read some information that is related to it to do so.

7\. Free to Download on Different Devices
