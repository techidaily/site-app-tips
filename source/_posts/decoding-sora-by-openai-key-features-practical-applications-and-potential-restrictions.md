## Part 1\. Knowledge That You Should Know about Sora

 Sora is another breakthrough in artificial Intelligence. Different from ChatGPT, which mainly processes natural word language, Sora aims to understand and stimulate the real physical world in motion. You can see OpenAI released a group of amazing video clips created by Sora:

* A stylish woman walking on Tokyo Street,
* Several giant wooly mammoths approach through a snowy meadow,
* A fluffy animated monster staring at a melting candle, etc.

 These clips demonstrate how powerful Sora is. It can create scenes for real and unresisting objects.

### Features of Sora

1\. Text-to-Video Capability

 As a simple AI text-to-video generator, all you need to create a video is a simple description of what you want to make and input it as prompts. This question-and-answer mode is very similar to ChatGPT.

2\. Advanced Generating

 Sora is not the first text-to-video tool in the market. Some models create video by stitching existing video clips or images, but Sora creates completely new video clips and ensures a dynamic synthesis of images and prompts instead of simple stitching and replacing.

3\. Natural Language Processing Capabilities

 Sora AI has advanced technology for understanding and interpreting Input text, including its semantics, context, and sentiments. This improvement enables Sora AI to generate more accurate visual representations.

4\. Multiple Working Sources

 Not only can Sora work on written prompts, but they can also read existing videos and extend the video at the beginning or the end. Still, images are also a kind of prompt for making videos.

5\. Customization Options

 Sora AI gives users the ability to customize various aspects of the generated videos, including visual styles, animation effects, color schemes, and typography. This allows users to trim the output to suit their specific needs and preferences.

6\. Video-to-video Editing

 Besides generating video from the input prompts, Sora also allows users to edit the video with text prompts. With SDEdit model. Sora can transform the video styles and environment and generate a new video.

### How Does Sora Work

 Sora uses text-to-video techniques to convert natural language into visual objects. When making a video, Sora will try to understand the meaning and context of the word including the visual part. The, it will extract the keywords and search the elements in its database. Next, it will combine those elements together and make a video. At last, if you have stylish preference, Sora will detect and add relevant filter with style transfer technology.

### What is Sora Used for

 Sora and create videos from written prompts or still images. Here are some use cases

1\. Social media

 You can make a short video with Sora and post it to social media platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, etc. As long as you have imagination and thoughts, you can do anything you want.

2\. Education

 Visualizing concepts is easier to understand for most people. With the help of Sora, teachers can make written words in textbooks alive as videos to let students see and learn.

3\. Advertising

 Film advertising is very expensive, but Sora offers a cheaper option and allows you to apply more novel ideas to your work.

## Part 2\. Limitation and Risk of OpenAI Sora

 OpenAI Sora is still available to the public because it is still under development and testing. Open AI has listed some limitations of Sora and people also have their questions and concerns.

### Limitation of OpenAI Sora

 1\. Sora doesn’t have a clear understanding of real-world physical rules. So, you may find some videos made by Sora is beyond people’s acknowledge. For example, if you create a video of a kid eating a cookie, the cookie may remain complete after one bite.

 2\. The model may also be confused about spatial details and the line of a prompt, resulting in mixing up left and right.

 3\. When creating crowded and cluttered scenes, Sora tends to generate unrealistic objects and overlays of different objects.

### Risks and Concerns over AI Sora

 Besides the functional limitation, we also need to consider what side effects it will bring.

 1\. Sora could be used to generate harmful content. Without restriction, Sora can produce inappropriate videos such as violence, sex, gore, etc. In the meanwhile, what is harmful content largely depends on the users, age, gender, nationality, etc.

 2\. How to distinguish Sora Video from real video recording is difficult. We know that Sora can create scenes that don’t exist or happen. What if it is used to make fake evidence, fake advertisements, and fake vote engagement?
