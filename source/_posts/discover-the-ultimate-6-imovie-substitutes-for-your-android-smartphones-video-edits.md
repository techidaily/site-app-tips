This app is correct to say that it is dynamic in terms of all editing it provides. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, using this app to produce high-quality video editing is an option you shouldn't miss out on. However, there are options on the interface that we find confusing to use, and not all of the features you can get on high-end video editors are presented on the app, even if you purchase a license to use it.

 Generally, the ShotCut app is a must to download on every device for quick video editing for presentations. It is considered in the tier of average video editor, which means it offers basics and some advanced video editing features.
