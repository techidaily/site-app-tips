How do I remove a watermark in AI?

 Many AI-powered watermark remover tools are available to remove unwanted watermarks with ease, including free online removers and professional desktop programs. You can select a desired tool, add your image, or video file, select the watermark region, and then let AI do the watermark removal.

 Is there a way to remove a watermark from a video without AI?

 Yes, you can manually remove a watermark from your video without AI. If the watermark is placed on the edge of the main content, you can choose to crop it out with a video editor. Also, you can choose to blur the watermark area and make it less noticeable. This blurring solution is mainly used for small watermarks. To remove a solid watermark from a video, you can also try converting it with an overlay.

Is removing a watermark illegal?

 Generally, removing a watermark from copyrighted content without permission is illegal, especially for commercial usage. In some cases, even if the content isn't copyrighted, it might have some license terms attached. These terms don’t allow you to remove the watermark. When you are unsure about the license terms or copyright status, you’d better not remove the watermark.  
 If you only want to remove a watermark for personal use, you are commonly considered fair to do that, even without permission. You can remove a watermark without distributing the content. You should know that you are not allowed to sell content with a removed watermark.
