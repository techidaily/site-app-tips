 Moreover, InShot Video Editor can also create a product photography background for images or edit the photos based on your needs.

### Evaluation of InShot from a Users Perspective

 InShot app provides everything a typical mobile video editor needs to process their videos on their portable devices. The app performs tremendously, and with its newest update, some bugs are fixed, and developers improve the app to become even better, which is excellent for editors. Even for beginners who want to edit, downloading the app can be a great addition to their arsenal of video editing apps on mobile devices.

 Thus far, the app isn't the best choice for layering or adding multiple videos and audio tracks, for the app only supports a single timeline which limits the creativity of its users. Even if the app can't reach that demand, it is still considered one of the best apps to download on mobile phones for video editing for some time now.

### Best Features that You Can Only Find on InShot

1\. Essential to Advanced Video Editing

 When it comes to a smooth InShot reverse video, the app always delivers the best output, and amazingly that is only considered one of the basic features. Starting from that, you can also use the app to trim, split, cut, merge, crop, cut, and rewind clips easily. For the advanced feature, you can get keyframes, PIP, and chroma keys for tracing green screen backgrounds and removing masks, mixtures, and color pickers. But before you can get a hand on these, you will need to purchase the plan it provides.

 2\. Easily Add Sound Tracks, Sound Effects & Voice-over

 The app offers an extensive library of pre-made music that you can use as a track on the video or sound effects. On InShot voiceover allows its editor to record an audio track while you are speaking and attach it to a video. With the audio track, you can engage the viewers in an immersive experience.

3\. Tons of Filters and Effects

 Since the app is a video editor, filters and effects are also available. You can easily maximize its potential to create an interactive video with the help of the app. Try all available filters and effects to see which fits your needs for video editing.

4\. Pre-made Canvas and Background Patterns

 While doing an InShot review, users can add a picture as a background; you can even use a picture of yours if you want to. Aside from that, you are far from failing to get the correct aspect ratio for the social media platform, for this app provides a set of pre-made canvases to use.

5\. Supports Exporting 4k Videos with 60 FPS

 After creating the video and processing it, you can now export the final output as 4k with 60 FPS; it is one of the highest quality you can get. However, the file size will also become more extensive, so you might need a[video compressor](https://tools.techidaily.com/) to reduce the file size. Also, you can't set the quality to the highest if you use the free version of the app, so you better purchase it to get the highest quality and resolution as exported.

 6\. Share Final Output Easily on Popular Social Media Platforms

 When the video you have created is exported, you can now share it through different social media platforms so that other people can see the magical editing you did with InShot. The app supports popular social media platforms for you to share the final output.
