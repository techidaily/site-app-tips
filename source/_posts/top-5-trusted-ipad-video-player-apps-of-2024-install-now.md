### 3\. PlayerXtreme

 For watching an intense video, you will need a video player for iPad likePlayerXtreme . The app supports a wide range of formats that aren't compatible with iPad, so you wouldn't need to convert the video file into a newer format. While watching the videos, you can easily take a quick snap of what you are watching. Elements such as clipping videos and A/V syncing are supported in this app and should be the ones you choose if these are what you want. Also, you can cast the video you are watching into a smart TV, but if you want to use that feature, you will need to go into pro, meaning you will need to purchase the app.

### 4\. OPlayer Lite

OPlayer Lite is the most lightweight iPad video player that you can download. Every feature this app provides is already on the interface though it has an advantage because you don't need to navigate the features, yet some users find the app has an unfriendly UI. While playing the video, you can easily access its settings or a feature even if you don't pause what you are watching. Like the mentioned application, this app supports streaming protocols, AirPlay, screen mirroring functions, and many others. It is too good to be true that the app has this function for free, so purchasing it should be done if you want to access its full features as a video player.

InFuse 7 is the most basic yet best video player for iPad devices. Like the other mentioned video players, the app supports many media files, so you can easily watch or listen to the file instantly.

Step 3:

 On the upper left side of the interface, click thedrop-down button and select the video format that you want it to be.

After selecting the format, you can select the available pre-made video settings or create a customized setting.

## Part 3\. FAQs about the iPad Video Players

 What are the supported video formats on iPad?

 The iPad devices only support MOV, MP4, MPEG-4, M-JPEG, M4V, and H.264, which is very limited compared to other devices such as Android. If your video isn't in these formats, you will need a third-party video player to support your video or convert the video into a newer format.

Is QuickTime supported on iPad?

 Even though Apple Inc. created QuickTime, it still doesn't support iOS devices, so you can rely on a system or third-party players on the market when video playing is needed.

Can I transfer iPad to Mac?

 Well, it is possible when you connect the charging cable of the iPad to Mac, but if that doesn't work, then you will need an app that supports the[iPad-to-Mac transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft/ios-transfer/) .

Conclusion

 If videos aren't playing on your iPad, then you might need an**iPad video player** as a quick solution to solve the problem. But, if you don't like downloading a video player, then you can easily use the application we added in part 2 to solve the problem.
