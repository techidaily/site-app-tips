"That way, we can tackle the biggest security threats facing the modern workforce and deliver on the promise of providing a safer life online for families and businesses around the world," Shiner continued.

1Password told ZDNet it would use the money to scale the platform and expand its offerings. Over the last year, the company increased its B2B business footprint, adding more than 100,000 companies as customers over the last 24 months.
