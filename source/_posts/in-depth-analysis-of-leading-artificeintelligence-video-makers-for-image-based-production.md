## Part 3\. FAQs of AI Video Generator from Image

Can AI create 4K videos from images?

 Most AI image to video generators currently don’t support 4K output. Generally, they will generate short video clips from your offered images. What’s more, these AI-generated videos usually carry a low quality. They are not as polished or detailed as traditionally captured or edited videos. However, you can rely on some AI upscaling tools to increase the video resolution to 4K. As AI technology is rapidly developing, there will finally be 4K-resolution videos from images in the future.

 Will AI video generators use footage online?

 Due to copyright restrictions and other reasons, most AI video generators currently don't directly use footage online. Instead, they usually use their own images and videos from internal libraries. Moreover, online footage may vary in quality, style, and other aspects. It would be difficult for AI to accurately recognize them and generate related content.

 Can I use AI-generated videos for personal use?

 In most cases, you can use AI-generated videos for personal use. Ensure you don’t share them with others or for commercial use. For the AI video generator you are using, you should check the terms of service. Some may have restrictions on how you can use the generated content. Moreover, you should make sure underlying content, like the images and music you used, does not violate any copyrights.

Can you use ChatGPT to make videos?

 ChatGPT currently doesn’t carry the capability to directly create videos. But you can use it to generate scripts or storyboards for video creations. Now, ChatGPT is mainly used for generating text content.

Conclusion

 Through my tests of over 30**AI video generators from images** , most can’t output high-quality videos. With the AI video generation technology constantly developing, we can expect new tools to bring more advanced features that can generate really useful content.
