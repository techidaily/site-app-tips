**Pros & Cons** 

**Pros** 
*** Great security**
*** Easy to use**
*** Fully-featured password manager**

**Cons** 
*** Advanced features require payment (although most users won't need these)**

**More Details** 

**Bitwarden believes that "everyone should have access to password security tools." To support this, the company offers a free subscription that provides unlimited syncing across all your devices, a password generator, and even the option to self-host your data.** 

**It's also platform-agnostic, offering Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android solutions. On the browser front, it covers Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and more, with open-source transparency as a bonus.**

**Also: [The best password managers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/)**

**For $10 a year -- yes, a year -- you can unlock advanced features such as Bitwarden Authenticator, two-step login and authentication, with YubiKey, U2F, Duo, a vault health report, and the ability to set up emergency access.**

**Bitwarden is a fantastic choice for those seeking a free or paid service. You can also sign up for a family plan at $3.33 per month or a business plan starting at $4 per month, per user. The company also provides customized options for corporate customers.**

**Users enjoy the transparent pricing model and say that 'it just works.' The extensions are excellent, although many would like to see changes to maintenance routines.**

**[NordPass Best LastPass alternative for business](https://go.nordpass.io/aff%5Fc?offer%5Fid=645&aff%5Fid=307&url%5Fid=24693&source=ZDNET&aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)** 

**Screenshot by Charlie Osborne/ZDNET**

**Pros & Cons** 

**Pros** 
*** Ability to store passwords and other data**
*** Unlimited device support**
*** The premium plan is very competitive**

**Cons** 
*** Free plan restricted to one active device**

**More Details** 

**Created by the same team behind NordVPN, NordPass is the best LastPass alternative password manager for businesses. It offers secure sharing, health reports, multi-factor authentication, and more. NordPass's data breach scanner will automatically scan the internet for your credential combinations, alerting you to any new data breaches or security incidents that result in the leak of your account details.** 

**NordPass offers business plans based on user numbers. Team plans with up to 10 users begin at $1.79/month per user. Features available include company-wide settings, Google Workspace SSO, a security dashboard, MS ADFS, and support for Okta user and group provisioning.**

**Options are also available for home users. The firm's free plan allows you to store unlimited passwords, notes, and credit cards and sync them to an unlimited number of devices, but you can only have one active device (in other words, you'll be logged out of other devices).**

**A step up, the premium plan, (starting at $1.19 a month if you take out a two-year subscription) is one of the best-value premium offerings out there. NordPass will include a data breach scanner, detection for weak and reused passwords, and the ability to stay logged in to up to six devices with one user account at a time. Three months of free access are included.**

**NordPass provides a 30-day money-back guarantee. A free trial is available for the home and business plans with no credit card required. Users say that the password manager is user-friendly, although the price can quickly add up.**

**[KeePass Best open-source LastPass alternative](https://keepass.info/)** 

**Screenshot via Charlie Osborne | ZDNET**

**Pros & Cons** 

**Pros** 
*** Free and open source**
*** Extremely customizable**

**Cons** 
*** Not cloud-based**
*** Outdated interface**

**More Details** 

**KeePass is not a cloud service, but a free, open-source, lightweight, and easy-to-use password manager for Windows. Not using Windows? There are unofficial ports for a variety of platforms, including Android, MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Indeed, there is a huge range of plugins and extensions available.** 

**However, it does lack the seamless cloud synchronization of many modern password managers, and this option is only suitable if you are confident in your technical knowledge. The latest release, v.2.56, includes user interface improvements and security enhancements.**

**Also: [The best free PC antivirus software](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-antivirus/)**

**Still, as an open-source offering, KeePass is a great (and free) LastPass alternative for more technically-minded users. Users note that while the interface is outdated, it is still easy to use and has a secure password management option.**

**Keepass features: Open source technologies | Password manager | AES-256, ChaCha20, and Twofish encryption | Database transfers | Password generator | Trustpilot rating: 4.3**

**[1Password Best LastPass alternative for overall security](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15654272-1698674279000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)** 

**Screenshot by Charlie Osborne/ZDNET**

**Pros & Cons** 

**Pros** 
*** Multi-platform**
*** Easy to use with modern apps including Okta**
*** Single sign-on support**

**Cons** 
*** No free plan**

**More Details** 

**1Password is an excellent choice for those who need a personal and business-ready solution and who want to keep an eye on their overall online security. You can save all manner of credentials, including online service passwords, financial data, and more -- and these secrets can be shared with family or sent individually, whether or not the recipient has a 1Password account.** 

**Also: [The best browsers for privacy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-browser-for-privacy/)**

**Another interesting feature is called "Watchtower," which provides information to subscribers to improve their security. Warnings are displayed for compromised or reused passwords, and data is provided on whether websites you're visiting are using modern authentication methods or are deemed insecure. In a recent update, the firm announced that you can check and mitigate potential SSH key security risks.**

**Personal plans start at $2.99 per month, whereas business plans begin at $7.99\. However, you can sign up for a plan to protect up to 10 employees in your business, the "Team Starter Pack," for $19.95 per month. Users say the firm's approach to data security is top-notch, and they have great customer support.**

**1Password f eatures: Multi-system compatibility | Consumer and business plans | Autofill | Password sharing | Watchtower feature to identify weak, reused, or compromised passwords | Tag and folder organizer | 14-day trial | Trustpilot rating: 4.7**

**[Google Chrome password storage Best LastPass alternative for Google Chrome users](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://passwords.google.com/)** 

**Screenshot via Charlie Osborne | ZDNET**

**Pros & Cons** 

**Pros** 
*** A great cross-platform solution for Google Chrome users**
*** Passwords accessible across different devices**

**Cons** 
*** Restricted to passwords and can't store other data like PIN codes and such**
*** Lacking the advanced security features of a dedicated password manager**

**More Details** 

**If you're a Google Chrome user, then you already have a cross-platform password manager that will work anywhere you have Google Chrome installed and signed in to your Google Account.**

**Also: [The best security keys](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-security-key/)**

**It works well for saving web and app login details and is easy to synchronize, but it's not really suited to other credentials like PIN codes. This password manager is worth considering if you're after a barebones password vault and you don't want a password storage solution you have to customize.**

**If you're an iOS or MacOS user, Apple's alternative is the [Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mchlf375f392/mac), and Apple has provided instructions for macOS versions up to the latest build, macOS Sonoma.**

**## What is the best LastPass alternative for you?**

**LastPass, despite recent restrictions for its free plans, remains a solid option for a password manager and security vault. However, if you want to explore alternative offerings, there is a huge range of options available to you.** 

**You should decide on an alternative by considering factors including price points, whether or not you need a multi-platform vault, and whether or not you are looking for a business-ready product.**

**## Factors to consider when choosing a LastPass alternative**

**When you are considering your options for a new LastPass alternative, consider the factors below.** 

*** Security: Security is the foremost priority when it comes to password managers. The most secure password managers offer advanced encryption and use secure protocols to protect personal information when transferring from the service to your device and vice versa.**
*** Open source: Open source options should be considered as the software is transparent and open to outside auditing for security vulnerabilities.**
*** Storage: Another important consideration is storage capacity. While some password managers limit the number of passwords you can store, others offer unlimited storage, so you can add all your information without restrictions.**
*** Compatibility: It's also essential to check if your preferred device is compatible with the password manager. The best options offer cross-platform compatibility, allowing you to access your data from multiple devices, including your computer, tablet, and mobile device.**

**## How did we choose these LastPass alternatives?**

**In putting together this list of the best password managers that would make great LastPass alternatives, we looked at third-party reviews and opinions from security experts. We also have hands-on experience with these password management tools, because that's the only way to really get to know how usable a service like this actually is.** 

**Our descriptions are designed to help you decide on an alternative to LastPass, depending on your situation, needs, and budget. After you narrow down possible contenders, you should test them yourself to ensure they meet your expectations.**

**When it comes to selecting a new password manager, there are several crucial factors to consider. These are some of the key elements that have determined the best options:**

*** Customer reviews: We consider customer experiences to be one of the most important factors -- even if a password manager is very secure, if usability is poor, it cannot be a great solution.**
*** Company reputation: As you will be trusting an organization to provide a secure lockbox for your credentials, we only include reputable vendors who perform frequent security audits.**
*** Use cases: We wanted to include a range of LastPass alternatives suitable for consumer and business use cases and purposes.**
*** Price: Lastly, while some password managers are free, others may require a paid subscription to access all features. It's important to weigh the cost against the benefits and select a password manager that meets your budget and feature requirements.**

**## How hard is it to move from one password manager to another?**

**Not hard at all. Most services offer ways to export your data as a CSV (Comma Separated Variable) file that can be imported into your destination service.**

**How this is done depends on the service you're moving from and to. Information on how to export a CSV file out of LastPass can be found on [LastPass' support page](https://support.lastpass.com/s/document-item?language=en%5FUS&bundleId=lastpass&topicId=LastPass/export-generic-csv.html&%5FLANG=enus). If you're finished with your old service, don't forget to delete your account after you've made your transfer.**

**## What is LastPass?**

**LastPass is a password manager that stores your passwords online so they can be accessed across your various devices. LastPass supports millions of users and its slogan is. "Prepare for a password\[less\] future by embracing pervasive password management today."**

**## How do password managers work?**

**Different password managers have different user experiences and different feature sets, but all offer subscribers a similar set of core features:** 

*** A password generator.**
*** Secure sharing of passwords with trusted contacts.**
*** Form filling, including the option to automatically enter credit card details.**
*** Secure notes.**
*** A sync engine that replicates the database across devices, using a cloud service or a local host.**
*** Sometimes, a data breach scanner may be included to alert you to compromised credentials.**

**## Are password managers 100% safe?**

**No password manager, or software in general, can be considered 100% safe. Unfortunately, security incidents happen and data breaches occur on a daily basis -- but the best password managers will utilize high levels of encryption (such as AES-256 encryption) and will not store your data centrally to prevent your credentials from falling into the wrong hands.** 

**## Can a password manager be hacked?**

**While no system is completely invulnerable to hacking, the best password managers use strong encryption algorithms and other security measures to protect your data. They also require a strong master password or passphrase to access your account. It is important to use a unique and complex master password and enable two-factor authentication to increase security further.**

**## What about going passwordless?**

**Passwords may, one day, become a thing of the past, although we have a long way to go. Passwordless [authentication systems](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-make-a-new-commitment-for-a-passwordless-future/) are linked most commonly to the FIDO Alliance, which promotes an open standard of passwordless authentication using passkeys. Passkeys are encrypted, safer than passwords, and use a key pair to authenticate at the time of a sign-in request, of which only you have the private key.** 

**## Are there any other LastPass alternatives worth considering?**

**If none of the above recommendations suit your needs, we have researched and listed several alternative password managers below.**
