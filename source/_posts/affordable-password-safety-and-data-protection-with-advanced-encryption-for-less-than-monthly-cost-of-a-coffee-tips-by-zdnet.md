While the man who lost the password to his Bitcoin wallet has apparently ["made peace"](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-owner-who-lost-password-made-peace-potentially-huge-loss-2021-1) with that loss, you'll never have to endure that if you use an affordable password manager to protect your data.
