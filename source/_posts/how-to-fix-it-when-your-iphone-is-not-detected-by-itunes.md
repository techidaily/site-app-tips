3 Navigate to iTunes Store, and input the name of your album on the search bar to find the correct album.

4 Get the album, and at the right side of the album, you can find the purchase button. From the drop-down button, get the "Copy Link", click it and open your Browser.

6 Navigate to iTunes, find the one which you want to add album artwork. Right click to "Get Info", on the popup window, choose "artwork"- "Add Artwork" – insert your saved artwork from Desktop – Click "OK"

7 You can get the album artworks on iTunes.

### The second way to get album artworks – from Google

 Some people do not have an iTunes account, so the first way is invalid for them. But don't worry. There are almost all album artworks on Google Images. If you want to find one, you can download it and save it on your Desktop.
