Still, most of the update focuses on its functionality and performance. Overall, the app provides the quickest way to edit, for it has a built-in automatic editor that processes the video users select.

### Key Features of GoPro Quik

3\. Get the Highest Output Resolution

 When the video you edited on the GoPro Quik app is finished, you can export the final output to your choice. You can set it to the highest that the app supports; however, the file size of it will become enormous, and it is not space-friendly, so you will need to shrink the video file size.
