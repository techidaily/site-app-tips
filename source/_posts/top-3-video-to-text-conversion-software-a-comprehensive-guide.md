## Top 3 Video Transcribers to Describe Video Content with Text

 Subtitles, little lines of text that usually appear at the bottom part of the screen, are an essential element of videos. They provide access to the audio portion of videos and ensure a full understanding of the content, especially for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

 Similarly, describing video to text unlocks the content for a wider audience and brings various benefits. Besides just creating subtitles, there are also other compelling reasons why you want to describe video content with text. This article explains what a**video transcriber** is and shares three popular options for you to choose from.

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Transcriber

 A video transcriber often refers to a tool or service that extracts audio content from a video and exports it as text. It can be an AI-powered transcriber software or a human. Professionals can listen to the audio and manually type out the audio content in words. For AI video transcription tools, they adopt advanced speech recognition technology to analyze the audio in your video and translate it into text.

## Part 3\. How to Transcribe a Video to Text

 As mentioned earlier, you can employ a human transcriptionist to transcribe your videos to text with the relatively best accuracy. Surely, human transcription is more expensive than AI video transcriber software. If you prefer to try some AI-powered video transcription platforms first, you can turn to Kapwing Video to Text, Vizard.ai, Happy Scribe Video to Text Converter, VEED.IO, or Flixier. These platforms can offer fast video description speeds compared to human solutions.

 After selecting a suitable video describer tool, you can upload or add your video, sign in to an account, and then let the software to the description work. Some platforms allow you to edit the generated text and export it with the desired format. In some cases, to use more advanced AI features or break some limits, you may need to purchase a license.

## Part 4\. FAQs of Video Transcriber

How does a video transcriber work?

 Video transcriber software usually relies on AI and speech recognition technologies to extract audio from video and then turn it into text. You can simply add your video, and the tool will automatically make the text transcription work. However, due to background noise, accents, and other factors, the final accuracy may vary. Also, the video transcription can be done by a human professional. That is the traditional method to transform a video into text. Compared with video transcribers, this human transcription solution offers higher accuracy.

 Can video transcribing software extract subtitles from a video?

 If the subtitles are embedded within the video file and can be turned on or off, you can use video transcribing software to easily extract closed captions from the video. These video editors or AI-powered platforms can recognize the embedded text and export it as a separate file. However, if these subtitles are burned onto the video image and can’t be customized, you may not easily extract subtitles. Even though some AI text recognition software claims to do that. The accuracy may not be high enough.

 Is there a free AI video transcriber Chrome extension?

 Yes, there are some free Chrome extensions offered on the Web Store to transcribe videos using AI, such as Notta, Fireflies.ai, Transkriptor, and more. However, these free extensions usually come with some limitations. For instance, they may limit the length of videos you can transcribe. Also, the free trials often give lower text description accuracy. You must upgrade to paid plans to break limits and improve accuracy.

Conclusion

 After reading this post, I hope you can know more useful information about**video description** . You can try the introduced video describer software to extract text from your video content. With the development of AI and speech recognition technologies, video transcription software may generate more accurate, just like human translation.
